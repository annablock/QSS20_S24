       "      <td>PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million in Restitution Payments Announced to Preserve North Carolina Wetlands</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON – North Carolina’s Waccamaw River watershed will benefit from a $1 million restitution order from a federal court, funding environmental projects to acquire and preserve wetlands in an area damaged by illegal releases of wastewater from a corporate hog farm, announced Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina. The organization has protected nearly 50,000 acres of lands with scenic, recreational, historic and ecological values. North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has saved streams and wetlands that provide clean water, forests that are havens for wildlife, working farms that provide local food and nature parks that everyone can enjoy.  More information about the Coastal Land Trust is available at www.coastallandtrust.org.</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million Settlement Reached for Natural Resource Damages at Superfund Site in Massachusetts</td>\n",
       "      <td>BOSTON– A $1-million settlement has been reached for natural resource damages (NRD) at the Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site in Walpole, Mass., the Departments of Justice and Interior (DOI), and the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General announced today.                The Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site includes 22 acres of contaminated land and water in Walpole. The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace &amp; Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>10 Las Vegas Men Indicted \\r\\nfor Falsifying Vehicle Emissions Tests</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal grand jury in Las Vegas today returned indictments against 10 Nevada-certified emissions testers for falsifying vehicle emissions test reports, the Justice Department announced.   Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) announced today that two subsidiaries of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc.—Emhart Industries Inc. and Black &amp; Decker Inc.—have agreed to clean up dioxin contaminated sediment and soil at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site in North Providence and Johnston, Rhode Island.  “We are pleased to reach a resolution through collaborative work with the responsible parties, EPA, and other stakeholders,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black &amp; Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black &amp; Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

       "0  PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077   \n",

Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina. The organization has protected nearly 50,000 acres of lands with scenic, recreational, historic and ecological values. North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has saved streams and wetlands that provide clean water, forests that are havens for wildlife, working farms that provide local food and nature parks that everyone can enjoy.  More information about the Coastal Land Trust is available at www.coastallandtrust.org.   \n",

The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace & Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.   \n",

Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section.   \n",

Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

       "'4909    The founder and majority owner of Insys Therapeutics Inc., was arrested today and charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to profit by using bribes and fraud to cause the illegal distribution of a Fentanyl spray intended for cancer patients experiencing breakthrough pain.\\xa0\"More than 20,000 Americans died of synthetic opioid overdoses last year, and millions are addicted to opioids. And yet some medical professionals would rather take advantage of the addicts than try to help them,\" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"This Justice Department will not tolerate this.\\xa0 We will hold accountable anyone – from street dealers to corporate executives -- who illegally contributes to this nationwide epidemic.\\xa0 And under the leadership of President Trump, we are fully committed to defeating this threat to the American people.”John N. Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, Ariz., a current member of the Board of Directors of Insys, was arrested this morning in Arizona and charged with RICO conspiracy, as well as other felonies, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. Kapoor, the former Executive Chairman of the Board and CEO of Insys, will appear in federal court in Phoenix today.\\xa0 He will appear in U.S. District Court in Boston at a later date.\\xa0The superseding indictment, unsealed today in Boston, also includes additional allegations against several former Insys executives and managers who were initially indicted in December 2016.The superseding indictment charges that Kapoor; Michael L. Babich, 40, of Scottsdale, Ariz., former CEO and President of the company; Alec Burlakoff, 42, of Charlotte, N.C., former Vice President of Sales; Richard M. Simon, 46, of Seal Beach, Calif., former National Director of Sales; former Regional Sales Directors Sunrise Lee, 36, of Bryant City, Mich., and Joseph A. Rowan, 43, of Panama City, Fla.; and former Vice President of Managed Markets, Michael J. Gurry, 53, of Scottsdale, Ariz., conspired to bribe practitioners in various states, many of whom operated pain clinics, in order to get them to prescribe a fentanyl-based pain medication.\\xa0 The medication, called “Subsys,” is a powerful narcotic intended to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain.\\xa0 In exchange for bribes and kickbacks, the practitioners wrote large numbers of prescriptions for the patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer.The indictment also alleges that Kapoor and the six former executives conspired to mislead and defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients.\\xa0 They achieved this goal by setting up the “reimbursement unit,” which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.\\xa0“In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions, Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit,” said Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb. “Today\\'s arrest and charges reflect our ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis from all angles. We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable - just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer.”“As alleged, these executives created a corporate culture at Insys that utilized deception and bribery as an acceptable business practice, deceiving patients, and conspiring with doctors and insurers,” said Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division. “The allegations of selling a highly addictive opioid cancer pain drug to patients who did not have cancer, make them no better than street-level drug dealers. Today\\'s charges mark an important step in holding pharmaceutical executives responsible for their part in the opioid crisis.\\xa0\\xa0 The FBI will vigorously investigate corrupt organizations with business practices that promote fraud with a total disregard for patient safety.”“These Insys executives allegedly fueled the opioid epidemic by paying doctors to needlessly prescribe an extremely dangerous and addictive form of fentanyl,” said Phillip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\\xa0 “Corporate executives intent on illegally driving up profits need to be aware they are now squarely in the sights of law enforcement.”“As alleged, Insys executives improperly influenced health care providers to prescribe a powerful opioid for patients who did not need it, and without complying with FDA requirements, thus putting patients at risk and contributing to the current opioid crisis,” said Mark A. McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Metro Washington Field Office. “Our office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue and bring to justice those who threaten the public health.”“Pharmaceutical companies whose products include controlled medications that can lead to addiction and overdose have a special obligation to operate in a trustworthy, transparent manner, because their customers’ health and safety and, indeed, very lives depend on it,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson.\\xa0 “DEA pledges to work with our law enforcement and regulatory partners nationwide to ensure that rules and regulations under the Controlled Substances Act are followed.”“Today’s arrest is the result of a joint effort to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in fraudulent activity and endanger patient health,” stated Special Agent in Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office.\\xa0 “DCIS will continue to work with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Massachusetts, and our law enforcement partners, to protect U.S. military members, retirees and their dependents and the integrity of TRICARE, the Defense Department’s healthcare system.”“As alleged, John Kapoor and other top executives committed fraud, placing profit before patient safety, to sell a highly potent and addictive opioid.\\xa0 EBSA will take every opportunity to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners in these important investigations to protect participants in private sector health plans and contribute in fighting the opioid epidemic,” said Susan A. Hensley, Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Boston Regional Office.“Once again, the United States Postal Inspection Service is fully committed to protecting our nation’s mail system from criminal misuse,” said Shelly Binkowski, Inspector in Charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. “We are proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners to dismantle high level prescription drug practices which directly contribute to the opioid abuse epidemic.\\xa0 This investigation highlights our commitment to defending our mail system from illegal misuse and ensuring public trust in the mail.”“The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate those that attempt to fraudulently impact programs designed to benefit our veterans and their families,” said Donna L. Neves, Special Agent in Charge of the VA OIG Northeast Field Office.The charges of conspiracy to commit RICO and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud each provide for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the amount of pecuniary gain or loss.\\xa0 The charges of conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law provide for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $25,000 fine. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.The investigation was conducted by a team that included the FBI; HHS-OIG; FDA Office of Criminal Investigations; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration; the Office of Personnel Management; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General; and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\xa0 The U.S. Attorney’s Office would like to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Offices around the country engaged in parallel investigations, including the District of Connecticut, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern District of Alabama, Southern District of New York, District of Rhode Island, and the District of New Hampshire.\\xa0 The efforts of the Central District of California and the Justice Department’s Civil Fraud Section of the Department of Justice are also greatly appreciated.\\xa0Assistant U.S. Attorneys K. Nathaniel Yeager, Chief of Weinreb’s Health Care Fraud Unit, and Susan M. Poswistilo, of Weinreb’s Civil Division, are prosecuting the case.The details contained in the charging documents are allegations.\\xa0 The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nName: contents, dtype: object'"

       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.</td>\n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.   \n",

Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

       "13068  The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.   \n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

       "      <td>In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment</td>\n",

Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "11593  In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment   \n",

Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.</td>\n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama announced.  According to evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Evans sexually abused the child on multiple occasions during the 18 months that the child lived with him from May 2007 to December 2008.  Trial Attorney Austin M.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case.

       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yuba City, California, Man Sentenced to 46 Months in Prison for Racially Motivated Attack on White Man and African-American Woman</td>\n",
       "      <td>Anthony Merrell Tyler, 34, of Yuba City, California, was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge John A. Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.   \n",

Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

       "13068  The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.   \n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

       "      <td>In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

       "6727  The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.</td>\n",

Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

During his plea, Smith admitted that he and a co-conspirator agreed to burn a cross together in order to intimidate the neighborhood’s African-American residents.  Using materials from around his home, the co-conspirator constructed a wooden cross about six feet tall and wrapped cloth around the cross.  The co-conspirator loaded the cross into Smith’s truck, and, with Smith driving while the co-conspirator provided directions, the two men transported the cross to a predominantly African-American residential neighborhood.  They unloaded the cross at the entrance to the community, where the co-conspirator poured fuel on the cross, stood it up in view of several houses and set it on fire. “The defendant’s crime illustrates the damage hate crimes can do to entire communities, making people feel unsafe in their own homes,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division.  “We’d like to think these offenses are a thing of the past, but the reality is that they happen here in the 21st century.  The Justice Department is committed to stamping them out.” “This defendant not only committed a federal crime, but committed a contemptible action of hate,” said U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr.  “Citizens in the Middle District of Alabama should not and will not tolerate such actions.  I hope this prosecution sends a clear message that these hateful demonstrations will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Smith faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.  This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Dale County Sheriff’s Office and the Ozark Police Department.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerusha T. Adams of the Middle District of Alabama and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Jay E. Town of the Northern District of Alabama.   Charles Mark McCormack, 54, of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, pleaded guilty to one count of production of child pornography before Chief U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre of the Northern District of Alabama.  Sentencing is set for April 3, 2018.   According to admissions made in connection with his guilty plea, between Aug. 1, 1997, and Oct. 15, 1998, McCormack used a minor, born in or about 1992, to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of the conduct, by videotaping the minor urinating in a bathroom in his residence in Colbert County, Alabama.  McCormack was employed as a kindergarten teacher during a May 2016 search of his residence, which resulted in law enforcement discovering fewer than 25 images of nude and topless females believed to constitute child pornography and a suitcase containing young girls’ panties.    The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Fortune of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.   This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

       "      <td>Jeremy Heath Higgins, 28, a resident of Quinton, Alabama, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Madeline Haikala to two counts of federal civil rights violations, announced the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama. As part of the plea proceedings, Higgins admitted that on June 14, 2013, he approached and threatened an African-American man at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse, a restaurant in Quinton, Alabama, because the man was present at the restaurant with a white woman. Soon after, the couple left the bar. A manager at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse confronted Higgins because of his behavior toward the African-American man and ordered Higgins to leave the restaurant. As Higgins was being escorted from the bar, he used racial slurs, shouted a racial slur at the restaurant manager, and threatened to burn down the Alabama Rose Steakhouse. Later that evening, Higgins returned to the restaurant and threatened the restaurant manager by painting graffiti on the restaurant’s front exterior and fence. Sentencing in this case is set for January 9, 2015.\\n“Threatening an individual over their race or a business for its acceptance of others has no place in a civilized society,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Molly Moran for the Civil Rights Division. “The Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute those who seek to intimidate others with these types of hateful threats.” “Access to public places, like restaurants, has been at the core of the civil rights struggle,” said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama. “Unlike the lunch counters of the 1960s, the restaurant in this case welcomed and sought to protect the rights of its African American customer. In prosecuting this case, we make clear our commitment to enforcing the civil rights of individuals and the businesses who seek to serve all, without regard to the color of their skin.” This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin B. Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Rick Lee Evans, 43, a truck driver from Talladega, Alabama, was convicted by a federal jury on Dec. 11, 2015, of one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child under 12.   According to the evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Trial evidence showed that from May 2007 to December 2008, while the child lived with Evans, he sexually abused the child on multiple occasions.  Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case. U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division and the FBI’s Birmingham, Alabama, Division investigated the case.

       "      <td>Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama and FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard D. Shwein Jr. announced that a Talladega County, Ala., man was sentenced in federal court today for attempting to hire members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to murder an African-American neighbor Allen Wayne Densen Morgan, 29, of Munford, Ala., pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre on Oct. 24, 2013, to one count of using and causing someone else to use interstate facilities and travel with the intent to commit a murder-for-hire.  At today’s sentencing hearing, Judge Bowdre sentenced Morgan to serve 72 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Morgan previously admitted that in August 2013, he attempted to hire members of the KKK to murder his neighbor.  According to Morgan’s plea agreement, on Aug. 22, 2013, Morgan spoke on the phone with an undercover FBI agent, who identified himself as a KKK member.  The men arranged to meet three days later at an Oxford, Ala., motel to discuss payment for the murder.  In that phone conversation, Morgan used a racial slur to describe the man he wanted killed and bragged that he had just fired several shots toward the man to intimidate him.  Morgan also described, in detail, how he wanted the man to be “hung from a tree like a deer and gutted,” to have body parts cut off and to “die a slow, painful death.”  On August 25, Morgan met with FBI agents posing as members of the KKK.  Morgan offered a watch, a necklace and a gun as payment for the murder and gave explicit directions for the man’s torture and murder.  “The defendant attempted to have his neighbor tortured and murdered by the KKK,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuels.  “Today’s sentence demonstrates that the Justice Department will continue to aggressively prosecute those who act on their racial hatred by seeking to inflict such acts of violence on others.” “Mr. Morgan detailed his calculated desire to end his neighbor's life through the most brutal and heinous means,” said U.S. Attorney Vance. “Today's sentence reinforces that vigilantism is not acceptable in our society and we will prosecute that crime.” This case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pat Meadows and Brad Felton of the Northern District of Alabama and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney David Reese.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An Anchorage, Alaska, man was sentenced for attempting to sexually exploit children in Cambodia over the course of four years and attempting to arrange a child sex tourism trip for himself and others to Cambodia, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen L. Loeffler of the District of Alaska.  Jason Jayavarman, 45, was sentenced yesterday to serve 216 months in prison and a lifetime term of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Sharon L. Gleason of the District of Alaska for his March 2015 conviction of attempted sexual exploitation of children and attempted travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place. The evidence presented at trial established that over the course of 12 trips to Cambodia between 2010 and his arrest in 2013, Jayavarman produced multiple videos of himself engaging in sexual acts with an individual who he believed to be a child.  Jayavarman then transported the recordings back to the United States.  According to trial evidence, Jayavarman also planned a trip for himself and others to Cambodia for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with children as young as 12 years old.  Trial evidence demonstrated that Jayavarman explained to one of the other potential travelers – who was an undercover FBI agent – how to groom a child for sex, avoid law enforcement detection and record high quality “mementos” of the sexual abuse.  Jayavarman’s child exploitation activities came to light following a concerned citizen’s anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers. The FBI and the Anchorage Police Department investigated the case.  Trial Attorney Ravi Sinha of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Audrey J. Renschen of the District of Alaska prosecuted the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen. L. Loeffler of the District of Alaska. Dr. Greg Alan Salard, 54, of Wrangell, Alaska, was found guilty on July 28, 2015, after a six-day trial before Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy M. Burgess of the District of Alaska, who also sentenced Salard late yesterday and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.  According to evidence presented at trial, between June and October 2014, an Internet Protocol address linked to Salard was used to share known child sexual exploitation files and a laptop computer seized from Salard’s home contained peer to peer software that was used to share one of the images identified during the investigation.  A forensic examination of the laptop uncovered evidence of hundreds of child sexual exploitation files, that multiple searches had been run on the laptop for a term associated with child sexual exploitation and that child sexual exploitation videos had been viewed on the computer.  The evidence also revealed that a program designed to erase or “wipe” computer files had been used multiple times, including on the morning the search warrant was executed. The FBI investigated the case, with assistance from the U.S. Forest Service; the Petersburg, Alaska, Police Department; the Wrangell Police Department; and the Juneau, Alaska, Police Department.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyle Reardon of the District of Alaska and Trial Attorney Leslie Williams Fisher of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) prosecuted the case.

       "      <td>The Department of Justice announced that this morning John W. Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On, Feb. 27, 2017, Michael John Harris, 34, was sentenced to six months imprisonment and one year of supervised release for making telephonic threats to two medical clinics in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that provide reproductive health services.     On March 2, 2016, Harris pleaded guilty to two violations of 18 U.S.C. § 248(a)(1).  During his plea hearing, Harris admitted that on May 12, 2014, he made telephonic threats to two different health clinics in Minneapolis that provide reproductive health services.  In a call to the first clinic, Harris threatened to kill the recipient of the call with his bare hands and to cut the recipient’s head off with a band saw.  In a call to the second clinic, Harris told the recipient that he was going to kill the recipient and the recipient’s co-workers, and that he was going to travel to the clinic and shoot everyone present.  Harris further admitted that he made these threats because the recipient was and has been, and in order to intimidate the recipient and any other person from, obtaining and providing reproductive health services.  “This defendant threatened these clinic workers with death and brutality,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The department is pleased that the defendant accepted responsibility and will face consequences for his actions. The Department is committed to vigorously enforcing the civil rights of all individuals in this country.” “The violence threatened by this defendant against health care workers is unacceptable,” said United States Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota.  “This sentence should serve as a reminder to individuals who would engage in such threats that the federal government will prosecute these crimes.” This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Risa Berkower of the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice and Assistant U.S. Attorney Manda M. Sertich of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today rejected a challenge to the conviction of James Ford Seale, a former member of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi. Seale was convicted by a federal jury in Mississippi in 2007 and sentenced to three life terms in prison. The jury determined that Seale and other Klansmen conspired to abduct, interrogate, beat and eventually murder Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie Moore, both 19 years old at the time of their murders. Seale appealed his convictions, arguing that a 1972 amendment to the federal kidnapping statute changed the statute of limitations to five years. In September 2008, a three-judge panel agreed with Seale, overturning his convictions. The United States successfully urged the full court to rehear the case and, in the meantime, to keep Seale in jail. Today, a divided court upheld the trial court’s decision to deny Seale’s motion to dismiss the indictment based on the statute of limitations. The appeal will return to the original three-judge panel to resolve the remaining issues. \"We are pleased with today’s decision rejecting the argument that it was too late to bring Seale to justice,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Based on evidence presented at trial, the jury determined that on May 2, 1964, Seale and his accomplices abducted Dee and Moore and drove the two young men into the Homochitto National Forest in Franklin County, Miss., where the Klansmen beat the victims, interrogated them at gunpoint and bound the two men with duct tape. The Klansmen then drove the victims to Parker’s Landing in Warren County, Miss., passing through the state of Louisiana, where the Klansmen secured Dee and Moore to heavy objects and threw them into the Old Mississippi River, drowning them. Seale is the first and only individual to be convicted for participating in the kidnapping and murders. The conviction of James Ford Seale is the result of the investigative work of the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, the Adam’s County Sheriff’s Office and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety also assisted in the investigation. This case was prosecuted by Dunn Lampton, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, and Special Litigation counsel Paige Fitzgerald and trial attorney Eric Gibson, both of the Civil Rights Division. The appeal was handled by attorney Tovah R. Calderon, also of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – David Dean, 43, of Peoria, Ariz., was sentenced today to 180 monthsin prison and a lifetime of supervised release for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton for the Western District of Pennsylvania and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton.          “The members of this criminal enterprise committed the most unthinkable of crimes – they trafficked in chilling images of children and infants being brutally, sexually abused.   And, they used a social networking website to distribute these images so that they could reach as many other like-minded individuals as they could,” said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.   “Our children, who are the most vulnerable and innocent in our society, deserve every measure of protection we can give them.   As this prosecution shows, we will use every tool we have to attack and dismantle these illegal child exploitation networks.”          “ This prosecution also illustrates the ripe environment for child predators that exists though the internet.  The defendants in this case found kinship online, validating their shared desire to engage in sex with children, and to seek sexual gratification through sharing horrific and degrading images of children,” said U.S. Attorney Hickton.  “We must respond to this threat with the full force of federal law enforcement and its many partners across agencies, jurisdictions, state lines, and national borders.  I am committed to this effort, and we will not stop until we eradicate this evil.”       “Possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime,” said ICE Director Morton. “Those who engage in this criminal behavior should be forewarned that ICE, along with our law enforcement partners, will use every tool at our disposal to end the sexual exploitation of our children and keep them safe wherever they live.”          On June 17, 2010, Dean pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Arthur A. Schwab in Pittsburgh to one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.  According to court documents and proceedings, Dean and others distributed images and videos of children being sexually abused to other members of an international group that had restricted membership and was formed on a social networking website.  Members of the group distributed to one another thousands of sexually explicit images and videos of children, many of which graphically depicted prepubescent, male children, including some infants, being sexually abused and sometimes sodomized or subjected to bondage.          Seven co-defendants have previously pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison as a result of this investigation.        This case was investigated by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and the High Technology Investigative Unit of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS).  Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig W. Haller and CEOS Trial Attorney Andrew McCormack prosecuted the case.       This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON –Frankie Maybee, 20, of Green Forest, Ark., was convicted today by a federal jury today of five counts of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime, announced the Justice Department.  This is the first conviction at trial for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.    Maybee faces a maximum of 55 years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000 per violation. On May 16, 2011, co-defendant Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime in connection with this matter.  Evidence presented at trial established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Maybee and Popejoy conspired to and did threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck.  When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims, and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims.  Maybee, driving his truck, rammed into the victims’ car repeatedly, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite.  As a result of Maybee and his co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “The defendants targeted five men because they were Hispanic, and today’s verdict shows that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously prosecuting individuals who perform acts of hate because of someone’s race or national origin,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.  “We will continue to use the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and every other tool in our law enforcement arsenal, to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever they occur.” “ We thank the jury for their careful consideration, and for their verdict. It is horrific that acts of violence are committed against complete strangers because of their race,” Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “In this case, five Hispanic men stopped to fill up their car with gas and were violently run off the road, causing severe injuries and nearly causing death to one of them. In the Western District of Arkansas, we will continue to prosecute acts of violence that are motivated by hatred of another’s race. ” This case was investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville, Ark., Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra E. Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark., pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., to one count of civil rights conspiracy, one count of interference with housing rights due to race and one count of possession of an unregistered firearm/destructive device for his involvement in the Jan. 14, 2011, racially motivated firebombing of the home of an interracial couple in Hardy, Ark. Dodson, along with Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, of Waldron; Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy, Ark.; and Wendy Treybig, 31, of Evening Shade, were indicted in April by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the racially motivated firebombing and their attempts to obstruct a federal investigation. During the plea proceedings, Dodson admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, while at a party at Barnwell’s house in Evening Shade, he, Murphy, Hammond and Barnwell devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. Dodson then drove all four men from Barnwell’s residence to the victims’ house in Hardy. When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. They damaged the victims’ house, however, the victims were not injured. “The victims’ home was attacked and their safety threatened because of their race. Such violence and intimidation has no place in our society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts of hate.” “Today’s plea begins the final chapter in a terrible story begun less than a year ago on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, in a small Northeast Arkansas community,” said Christopher R. Thyer, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  “Racially motivated violence, more than any other type, tears at the very fabric of what makes America and Arkansas great.  We should be celebrating our diversity rather than committing acts of violence because of it.  When it occurs, my office will vigorously prosecute it.” Dodson faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for April 6, 2012. Barnwell, Murphy, Hammond and Treybig have already pleaded guilty for their involvement in this matter. This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Barnwell pleaded guilty to one count of civil rights conspiracy and one count of use of fire during the commission of a felony in connection with the incident. Barnwell also pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon for illegally possessing a firearm on March 16, 2011, the Department of Justice announced today. Barnwell, along with Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, also of Waldron; Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy; and Wendy Treybig, 31, of Evening Shade, were indicted in April 2011 by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the racially motivated firebombing and subsequent attempt to obstruct a federal investigation.

When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. The victims’ house sustained some damage; however, the victims were not injured. Barnwell also admitted to illegally possessing a firearm after he had been convicted of a felony. “We simply will not tolerate racially-motivated violence in this country,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such heinous acts.” “This joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; along with the Arkansas State Police; the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments; and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices demonstrates how seriously all levels and branches of law enforcement consider these acts of prejudice, intolerance, and intimidation,” said Christopher R. Thyer, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. “ We are committed to protect the civil rights of all citizens of the Eastern District of Arkansas.” Barnwell faces a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for Dec. 20, 2011. Murphy, Hammond and Treybig previously pleaded guilty for their involvement in this matter. Gary Dodson is scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 25, 2011.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice today announced that Paul Schlesselman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a presidential candidate, and one count of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Schlesselman faces a sentence of 10 years under the plea agreement. A sentencing date of April 15, 2010, was set by Judge J. Daniel Breen, who is presiding over the case in Jackson, Tenn. Schlesselman of West Helena, Ark., admitted to conspiring to murder dozens of people, with a focus on murdering African-Americans. He further acknowledged that he intended to culminate his killing spree by assassinating then-Senator Barack Obama, who was a presidential candidate at the time. \"Despite great civil rights progress, hate-fueled violence remains all too common in our country, as illustrated by this unthinkable conspiracy,\" said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Tragedy was averted thanks to the capable work of the Crockett County Sheriff’s Department and their willingness to work with the ATF, the Secret Service and the FBI.\" \"Crimes committed against individuals because of their race will not be tolerated,\" said Lawrence J. Laurenzi, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. \"I commend the work of the investigative agencies in thwarting what could have been a series of tragic events.\" Schlesselman admitted that beginning on or about Sept. 1, 2008, and continuing until Oct. 22, 2008, he conspired to transport firearms and ammunition in interstate commerce, steal firearms from a licensed firearms dealer and transport in interstate commerce a short-barreled shotgun, all for the purpose of committing murders, robberies and burglaries. Schlesselman further acknowledged that on Oct. 20, 2008, he unlawfully transported an unregistered short barreled shotgun and a .357 magnum caliber handgun across state lines for the purpose of committing felonies, including racially targeted murders. Schlesselman also admitted that on Oct. 23, 2008, he threatened to kill and inflict bodily harm on President Barack Obama, who was a presidential candidate at the time. The case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Secret Service; the FBI; and the Crockett County Sheriff’s Office. The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Larry Laurenzi, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Powell and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Jonathan Skrmetti.</td>\n",

Coffee, along with co-defendants, Tony Branscum, 25, and Bradley Branscum, 23, also of Salado, were indicted in November 2010, by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other related federal charges stemming from their participation in the cross burning. Tony and Bradley Branscum, who are cousins, pleaded guilty last week for their roles in the cross burning. Coffee admitted in court that on the night of Aug. 28, 2010, he, along with his co-defendants, devised a plan to burn a cross in the yard of an African-American in the Salado community. Thereafter, Tony Branscum constructed a wooden cross in a workshop behind his house. The men then covered the cross in gasoline-soaked clothing and Brad Branscum drove them and the cross to the victim’s residence. Upon arriving at the residence, Coffee propped up the cross on a satellite dish and ignited it. “The burning cross is an unmistakable symbol of bigotry and hate, and to use it to threaten a person with violence because of his race is intolerable in this nation,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “We will continue to aggressively prosecute hate crimes of this kind.” Coffee faces up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000. This case was investigated by the Little Rock, Ark., Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today that Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, Ark., pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. This is the first conviction for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.   Information presented during the plea hearing established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Popejoy admitted that he was part of a conspiracy to threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck. When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims. The co-conspirator rammed into the victims' car, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite. As a result of the co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “James Byrd, Jr. and Matthew Shepard were brutally murdered more than a decade ago, and today the first defendant is convicted for a hate crime under the critical new law enacted in their names,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “It is unacceptable that violent acts of hate committed because of someone’s race continue to occur in 2011, and the department will continue to use every available tool to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever and wherever they occur.  “It is terrible and disturbing that violence motivated by hatred of another’s race continues to occur,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “We are committed to prosecuting such crimes in the Western District of Arkansas.” If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dustin Nix of Donaldson, Ark, was sentenced today in federal court in Fort Smith, Ark, on federal civil rights charges related to a conspiracy to drive a woman and her children from their home because they associated with African-Americans. Nix was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, three years of post-incarceration supervision, a fine of $5,000, and a $200 special assessment. Nix pleaded guilty on July 10, 2009, to two felony civil rights charges for conspiring to violate, and violating, the civil rights of the victims. In the plea proceedings and documents filed in court, Nix admitted that in June 2008, he conspired with others to force the victims to leave Donaldson because they associated with African-Americans. Specifically, on June 15, 2008, Nix and the others agreed to construct a cross and burn it in front of the victims’ home. Nix was present for and aided in the construction of the cross. Then, on June 21, 2008, Nix and others drove the cross to the victims’ home. Nix and the others erected the cross in front of the victims’ home and attempted to set it on fire. Nix admitted that he understood that the purpose of burning the cross was to threaten and intimidate the victims, and that it was not intended as a joke or prank. Nix’s co-conspirators, Jacob A. Wingo, Richard W. Robins, Clayton D. Morrison and Darren E. McKim, pleaded guilty in September 2009, for their roles in the conspiracy. Sentencing for Wingo, Robins, Morrison and McKim has been scheduled for Dec. 7, 2009. \"Driven by bigotry and hate, the defendants in this case threatened a young family with violence simply because they associated with persons of another race. Threats of this kind have no place in America,\" said Assistant Attorney General Perez. \"Aggressive prosecution of hate crimes is a top priority for the Civil Rights Division, and the defendant’s conviction should send a message to others who would carry out similar criminal acts that they will be brought to justice.\" Special Agents from the FBI’s Little Rock Field Office investigated this matter. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Quinn for the Western District of Arkansas, along with Special Litigation Counsel Gerard Hogan and Trial Attorney Benjamin Hawk of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.</td>\n",

On Jan. 14, 2010, Schlesselman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a presidential candidate, and one count of possessing a firearm. Today, U.S. District Judge J.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice announced today that Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark., was sentenced in Little Rock, Ark., for his involvement in firebombing the residence of an interracial couple. On Aug. 26, 2011, Barnwell pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the civil rights of a resident of Hardy, Ark., and to using fire in the commission of that offense. Barnwell also pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. District Judge Billy Roy Wilson sentenced Barnwell to 20 years in prison for the three counts. During his plea, Barnwell admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, he hosted a party where he and three other men, Jake Murphy, Dustin Hammond and Gary Dodson, devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. The men then went to the victims’ house in Hardy and when they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. The Molotov cocktails ignited and damaged the victims’ house; however, the victims fortunately were not injured. Murphy and Hammond have already pleaded guilty to civil rights violations for their role in this incident. Both defendants received sentences of 54 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. In June 2011, Wendy Treybig, who co-hosted the party on Jan. 14, 2011, with Barnwell, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. She was sentenced on Dec.13, 2011, to 21 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Gary Dodson pleaded guilty on Dec.7, 2011, and will be sentenced on April 6, 2011. “This defendant not only committed acts of race-based violence, but recruited others to commit these hate-filled crimes as well. There is no place in our society for criminal acts such as these,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts.” This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Henry Leventis and Cindy Chung of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. They damaged the victims’ house; however, no one was injured. Murphy and Hammond previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to and violating the civil rights of the victim. Both received sentences of 54 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. In June 2011, Wendy Treybig, who co-hosted the party on Jan. 14, 2011, with Barnwell, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. She was sentenced on Dec. 13, 2011, to 21 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. Jason Barnwell pleaded guilty on Aug. 26, 2011, and was sentenced on Jan. 27, 2012 to 20 years incarceration. “With today’s sentencing, we can finally close the book on this terrible incident of racial hatred,” stated Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez. “The sentence reflects the gravity of these kinds of crimes. The Civil Rights Division will continue to pursue justice in hate crimes such as these, where victims are targeted because of the color of their skin.” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas Christopher R. Thyer said, “The very strength we have in our communities is a result of the diversity of its people. Those who perpetrate crimes against others solely because of racial differences will find, as these four defendants have, that there is a price to pay. The laws that protect our communities leave no tolerance for hate crimes.” This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Jus tice Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today the arrest of Sean Popejoy, 19, and Frankie Maybee, 20, both of Green Forest, Ark., on charges related to a racially-motivated assault on five Hispanic men. A federal grand jury in the Western District of Arkansas returned an indictment on April 5, 2011, charging Popejoy and Maybee with federal hate crime charges and conspiracy to commit a federal hate crime. According to the indictment, Popejoy and Maybee have been charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009. Specifically, the indictment alleges that on June 20, 2010, the defendants yelled anti-Latino epithets at the victims while at a gas station parking lot. When the victims drove away, the defendants chased after them in the defendants’ truck. The defendants eventually caught up to the victims’ car and repeatedly rammed their truck into the victims’ car, causing the victims’ car to go off the road, overturn and ignite. All five of the victims were physically injured as a result of the defendants’ actions. If convicted, the defendants face maximum penalties of 10 years in prison on each of the civil rights charges. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office. The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.</td>\n",

Tony Branscum was sentenced on Jan. 20, 2012, to 18 months in prison. Bradley Branscum and Curtis Coffee were sentenced today. Bradley Branscum was sentenced to seven months in prison and Curtis Coffee was sentenced today to 18 months in prison. On Aug. 28, 2010, the three men and a juvenile constructed a cross, placed it in the yard of an African-American resident of Salado and lit it on fire. The defendants then drove away. The resident did not suffer injury, and his home was not damaged. All three men had previously pleaded guilty in this case to interfering with the housing rights of another. “The defendants acted to instill fear because of the victim’s race,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Department of Justice remains committed to protecting our communities from such violence and will continue to aggressively prosecute these acts.” This case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by AUSA John Ray White, of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Trial Attorney Cindy Chung of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – Frankie Maybee, 20, and Sean Popejoy, 19, both of Green Forest, Ark., were sentenced for their roles in committing federal hate crimes, announced the Justice Department.  These are the first defendants to be sentenced under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009. Maybee was sentenced today to 135 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Popejoy, who testified against Maybee, was sentenced yesterday to 48 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. Maybee and Popejoy were also sentenced to pay $5,440 in restitution to the victims, jointly and severally. Maybee was convicted on May 19, 2011, by a federal jury of five counts of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. Popejoy pleaded guilty on May 16, 2011, to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. Evidence presented at trial established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Maybee and Popejoy targeted five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot. Though Maybee and Popejoy did not know the men and the five did not do or say anything to provoke them, Maybee and Popejoy yelled racial epithets at the men and told them to “go back to Mexico.” When the victims drove away, the co-conspirators pursued them in Maybee’s truck.  When Maybee and Popejoy caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims, and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims.  Maybee, driving his truck, rammed into the victims’ car repeatedly, causing the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite.  The victims were badly injured and one of the victims sustained life-threatening injuries. “The facts of this case shock the conscience. Five men were almost killed for no reason other than the fact that they are Hispanic. The Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act allowed us to bring these men to justice in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “These sentences send a clear message that the Justice Department will aggressively prosecute those who perpetrate violent acts of hate.” “Acts of violence that occur simply because of how someone looks are horrific,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “The five victims in this case were targeted because they are Hispanic. That is reprehensible. We thank the jury – 12 individuals from communities across Northern Arkansas - for their careful consideration of the evidence and for holding the defendants accountable for their actions. We hope that acts like this never occur. However, if they do, we will vigorously prosecute them.” “Hate crimes have wide-ranging impact, as their perpetrators attack the victim and intimidate entire communities,” stated FBI Little Rock, Ark., Special Agent-in-Charge Valerie Parlave.   “The FBI will continue to collaborate with our state and local partners to investigate and provide important training to address violent hate crimes that are bias-motivated.  We will also work with our community partners, such as the Arkansas Civil Rights Working Group, to develop strategies to address and reduce civil rights abuses.” This case was investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville, Ark., Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Edward Chung and Cindy Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra E. Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.</td>\n",

Treybig, along with Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade; Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, of Waldron; and Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy, Ark., were indicted in April by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the firebombing and subsequent cover-up. Murphy and Hammond have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Treybig admitted in court that she lied to FBI agents about her knowledge of what happened on the night of the incident. Treybig also admitted that she urged a friend to provide to the FBI a false story that would serve as an alibi for her co-defendants. “Threatening a couple with violence because of their race will not be tolerated in our country,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute individuals that violate the rights of others because of race. Treybig faces up to 20 years in prison. Barnwell and Dodson are scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 25, 2011.

Means to 14 months in federal prison, following his guilty plea in February 2011 to a hate crime charge stemming from an arson of a children’s playground at the Dar El-Eman Islamic Center in Arlington in July 2010, the Justice Department announced today. Glaspell admitted that he set fire to playground equipment at the mosque as part of a series of ethnically-motivated acts directed at individuals of Arab or Middle Eastern descent associated with the mosque.  Glaspell further admitted that he stole and damaged mosque property, threw used cat litter at the front door of the mosque and shouted racial or ethnic slurs at individuals of Arab or Middle Eastern descent at the mosque on multiple occasions. Judge Means ordered that Glaspell, who has been on bond, surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on Nov. 21, 2011. “The defendant targeted Arab-Americans at a mosque where families worship peacefully and children play,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to vigorously prosecuting hate crimes against all persons and incidents of this kind will not be tolerated in our country.” “Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to build places of worship and assemble, free from discrimination,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. “This office will continue to prosecute those who commit such reprehensible acts of hatred.” This case was investigated by Arlington Police Department and the FBI.  It was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Victor Boutros from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Lewis of the Northern District of Texas, with assistance from the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Stafford, Virginia, man who serves as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army was sentenced today to serve 240 months in prison for production of child pornography and attempted coercion and enticement of a minor using social media and instant messaging apps. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI’s Washington Field Office made the announcement.  Steven Jon Frederiksen, 42, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee of the Eastern District of Virginia, who also ordered him to serve a 20 year term of supervised release.  On Aug. 2, 2016, Frederiksen pleaded guilty to one count of production of child pornography and one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. In November 2015, the FBI received notification that Frederiksen, at the time an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), was utilizing his government-issued laptop to engage in the production of child pornography.  Frederiksen admitted in connection with his plea agreement that he used online chat programs, including Kik, to entice at least four minor girls, ranging in age from 14 to 17, to produce child pornography via the internet, which he then organized and saved in an online cloud storage account.  He attempted to do this with at least two other minor girls.  The defendant also possessed additional images of child pornography and exchanged child pornography with other individuals online. The FBI’s Washington Field Office investigated the case with assistance from the Army Criminal Investigative Command in Fort Belvoir.  Trial Attorneys James E. Burke IV and Lauren Britsch of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) prosecuted the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Arson Awareness Week 2017 to Focus on Preventing Arson at Houses of Worship</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that its Civil Rights Division is partnering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s U.S. Fire Administration on this year’s Arson Awareness Week, May 7-13, with a focus on Preventing Arson at Houses of Worship. There were an average of 103 arsons of houses of worship per year from 2000 to 2015.  Half of all reported fires at houses of worship turn out to involve arson. The Department of Justice enforces a number of federal statutes protecting places of worship from attack, including 18 U.S.C. § 247, known as the Church Arson Prevention Act, which was passed in the 1990s in response to a sharp increase in church arsons.  That law makes it a federal crime to target religious property because of the religion or race of the congregation.  In February of this year, the Department indicted an Idaho man under § 247 alleging that he set fire to a Catholic Church in Bonner’s Ferry in April 2016.  In 2013, an Indiana man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for setting a fire at the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. FEMA and the Department of Justice have produced a number of materials to help congregations, community organizations and local law enforcement and fire safety officials to increase arson awareness and hold events highlighting proactive steps that can be taken to try to reduce house of worship arson.  These materials are available at the Arson Awareness Week homepage, www.usfa.fema.gov/aaw.  “Arson against houses of worship is a serious crime that the Department of Justice is committed to prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “But our role as prosecutors, while critically important, only comes after the fact when the damage is already done.  That is why we encourage communities and local officials to take proactive steps to increase public awareness of the problem and measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of house of worship arson.” Further information about hate crimes, including arsons against on places of worship, is available at the Civil Rights Division hate crimes page, https://www.justice.gov/crt/hate-crimes-0.</td>\n",

       "      <td>John Hall, 27, an Aryan Brotherhood member and inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Seagoville, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor after pleading guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act stemming from his assault of a fellow inmate, whom he believed to be gay, the Department of Justice announced. Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – Attorney General Eric Holder today honored 52 prosecutors, law enforcement partners and victim advocates in 13 communities for their     leadership protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation. The awards were presented at the 2011 National Strategy Conference on Combating Child Exploitation in San Jose, Calif.       Attorney General Eric Holder has made one of the department’s four key priorities the protection of those most vulnerable – children, the elderly, and victims of hate crimes, human trafficking and exploitation.          “Through their work in urban, rural and tribal communities – and through cutting-edge online efforts – these individuals are advancing bold, innovative and collaborative solutions to keep our children safe from all forms of exploitation and abuse,” said Attorney General Holder. “By focusing on prevention and intervention, as well as proven enforcement and prosecution strategies, these award recipients are strengthening our ability to protect children in need and at risk, and to bring offenders to justice.”‪       Focused on protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation, the conference held this week in San Jose is bringing together more than 1,000 investigators, agents and prosecutors from all levels of government to receive state-of-the-art instruction in investigative techniques, court room advocacy, digital forensics, behavioral profiling, victim advocacy and community outreach.        The conference is sponsored by the department’s Project Safe Childhood Initiative and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Overall Partnership Coalition to the    San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force   The group of 20 members and affiliates are honored for their efforts in combating child exploitation crimes and promoting safer and more secure communities throughout the Southern District of California.       The San Diego (ICAC) Task Force employs a number of successful strategies to combat child exploitation, which include: training across jurisdictions on topics of mutual interest; cross-designated state law enforcement offices as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals; regular meetings with full and part-time members; and an emphasis on coordination between the district attorney’s office and U.S. Attorney’s office.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Community Outreach Efforts to    three prosecutors and a community relations officer in the Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney’s Office for the launch of their effort, “Internet Safety—It’s Not Just the Computer Anymore.” Since its launch in January 2010, the program has held discussions on Project Safe Childhood and Internet safety with more than 2,500 educators, parents and students.   The program’s continued growth and development includes a total of 12 Assistant U.S. Attorneys making presentations, in both English and Spanish, to teachers, school administrators, parents and youth.         The four award winners from the Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney’s Office   are Robert Stabe, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division; Sherri Zack, Assistant U.S. Attorney; Megan Paulson, Assistant U.S. Attorney; and Rob Barnes, Community Relations Coordinator. They are being honored for their launch of, “Internet Safety—It’s Not Just the Computer Anymore.”        Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Multi-Agency Operation to four Washington, D.C., law enforcement officials.   The four award winners are Timothy Palchak, Detective for the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department; Chadwick M. Elgersma, Associate Division Counsel of the FBI; Scott Schelble, Relief Supervisor for the National Capital Response Squad of the FBI; and Keith Becker, Trial Attorney for the Child Exploitation/Obscenity Section of the Justice Department.          The awardees are honored for their work in a series of child pornography, enticing and traveler cases, which led to the rescues of four child victims from three separate homes. The prosecutions began as a single distribution of child pornography case which, on account of the extraordinary efforts by these four individuals, resulted in the successful prosecution of six sexual offenders.   Four of the offenders were “hands-on” child sexual abusers who produced child pornography in four jurisdictions.   The offenders were sentenced to lengthy prison terms ranging from 15 to more than 27 years in prison.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Multi-Agency Operation to three North Carolina and Massachusetts law enforcement officials.   The three award winners are E. Michael Smith Jr., Special Agent for the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; Gregory D. Squire, Special Agent for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Boston; and Joe Exum Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.       The awardees are honored for their work which led to the rescue of a six-year-old child exploitation victim and successful prosecution of the sex offender.   In collaboration with state, local and federal authorities, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina prosecuted and convicted a sex offender for exploitation of a six-year-old child, obtaining the maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.   While the sentence is significant, the most compelling aspect of the case is the apparent seamlessness with which a federal agent in Boston, coordinated with a state law enforcement agent in North Carolina, who in turn worked with state, federal and local law enforcement and prosecutors to follow through on the lead.   This group exhibited exceptional cooperation and a swift response so that a child in rural North Carolina could be rescued quickly.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Superior Performance in Victim Services to    Felice Weiler, the Victim and Witness Specialist for the U.S. Attorney’s office of the Northern District of Illinois, for her outstanding work on behalf of victims in the prosecution of a sex offender.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Prevention Strategy to Tommy Loftis, Law Enforcement Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Alabama for his presentation, “The Hidden Dangers of the Digital Age,” promoting child Internet safety.   During the past three years, Loftis has presented an informative and captivating program to more than 15,000 students and 5,000 parents throughout the Southern District of Alabama.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Overall Partnership Coalition to seven Florida and Hawaii law enforcement offices.   The seven office awardees are the Broward, Fla., Sheriff’s Office; Miami-Dade Police Department; Miami Beach Police Department; the Honolulu Division of the FBI; the Miami Division of the FBI; the U.S. Secret Service Miami office; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida.       The offices are honored for their work in combating domestic sex trafficking of minors in South Florida. Through close partnerships, shared resources and tireless work, the group’s efforts have resulted in the indictment of more than 16 cases, charging more than 25 defendants for the domestic sex trafficking of minors.   In 2010, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Southern Florida had approximately five cases proceed to trial involving the sex trafficking of minors.   Despite the many significant challenges faced by the prosecution teams, all defendants were found guilty.          Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Prevention Strategy to nine Ohio law enforcement officials affiliated with the     Franklin County, Ohio, Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force.     The nine award winners are Deputy Chief Steve Martin of the Franklin, Ohio, County Sheriff’s Office; Corporal Dan Johnson of the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office; Detective Marcus Penwell of the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office; Detective Jane Junk of the Columbus, Ohio, Police Department; Officer John Priest of the Upper Arlington, Ohio, Police Department; Detective Brett Peachey of the Westerville, Ohio, Police Department; Officer Steve Grubbs of the Westerville Police Department; Agent Justin Myers of Homeland Security Investigations; and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael J. Hunter.       The awardees are honored for their work in combating child exploitation crimes throughout the Southern District of Ohio.   Established in May of 2009, the Franklin County ICAC Task Force has demonstrated innovation and a consistent ability to adapt its techniques and practices to aggressively target child exploitation offenders in Central Ohio for arrest and prosecution.   The ICAC employs several innovative strategies to combat child exploitation, including the training of multiple officers in computer forensics, partnering with federal agencies, cross-deputizing task force officers as federal agents and coordinating a prosecution strategy with the U.S. Attorney’s Office.     Its successes include arresting more than 180 child exploitation defendants – including nine repeat offenders – executing more than 150 search warrants, identifying 10 child victims and referring 27 cases for federal prosecution.          Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Interdiction Strategy to two U.S. postal inspectors.   The award winners are William E.S. Beaty, Postal Inspector for the Seattle Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Gary Nork, Postal Inspector for the Phoenix Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.       The two awardees are honored for their work to ensure that a sex offender would not exploit children through the Internet and U.S. Mail. Working together, these two postal inspectors from two different states not only devised a strategy to identify the suspect and interdict the communications, but also secured the prosecution of the sex offender.   Within 48 hours of receiving a complaint from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, these postal inspectors acted to rescue a 12-year-old boy from a dangerous predator.            Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Local Prosecutor’s Office to Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff for his efforts in combating child exploitation crimes and promoting safer and more secure communities throughout the state of Utah.       Led by Utah Attorney General Mark L. Shurtleff, the Utah Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force has conducted more than 700 investigations of child exploitation; engaged in community outreach with parents and children to discuss online safety; set up Utah’s Amber Alert program; and established the first statewide Child Abduction Response Team in Utah.   The Utah Attorney General’s Office and the ICAC have also collaborated with other agencies, resulting in several significant child exploitation prosecutions by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the following proclamation commemorating January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month: “Human trafficking is a nationwide public health and civil rights crisis. Its victims are everywhere: at truck stops, in cities, in rural areas, and in suburbs, and who now total an unconscionable 25 million victims globally according to some estimates. That means 25 million human beings—parents, siblings, and children—have been coerced into a commercial sex act, forced into labor, or exploited because they desperately seek a better life. It is a priority of the Department of Justice to combat this depraved and predatory behavior through swift and aggressive enforcement of our nation’s laws to bring traffickers to justice and restore the lives of victims and survivors. “The Justice Department’s U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), other federal agencies, and our state, local, and tribal partners, are on the front lines, leading our shared fight against human trafficking in all its forms.  These entities are supported by the Department’s Civil Rights Division which is home to a team of dedicated investigators and prosecutors—the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit (the HTPU)—tasked with bringing human traffickers to justice and vindicating the rights of their victims. Additionally, the Department’s Criminal Division includes the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), which is committed to harnessing expertise in attacking the technological and systemic challenges that are involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, as well as other specialized prosecution teams who bring expertise in organized crime and money laundering. “Our efforts have produced high-impact prosecutions to dismantle transnational organized human trafficking enterprises, have launched interagency anti-trafficking initiatives with unprecedented momentum, and have vindicated the rights and freedoms of countless victims and survivors.  “These efforts resulted in the conviction of nearly 500 defendants in trafficking cases in fiscal year 2017, and making $47 million available to help trafficking survivors.  Last fall, the FBI—along with state and local task forces and international law enforcement partners—recovered 84 minors and arrested 120 traffickers, as part a single week-long operation. However, we are keenly aware that many challenges lie ahead and we are committed to taking our efforts to the next level. “In his Presidential Proclamation, President Trump asked us to ‘recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement’ and to ‘pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking.’ In the spirit of the President’s request, the Justice Department is hosting a Human Trafficking Summit in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 2018, two days before Super Bowl LII.  The Super Bowl provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the surge in commercial sex activity around major sporting events, and of our commitment to finding and protecting sex trafficking victims who are at risk of being compelled, coerced, or exploited as minors in that context. “The Human Trafficking Summit will be led by Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand and will convene law enforcement, victim support organizations, and the business community to focus on enhancing the strong partnerships behind all successful anti-trafficking efforts and identifying opportunities to increase collaboration and coordination as we take on new challenges. “There is no room in a civilized society for those who choose to violate an individual’s rights and freedoms by subjecting them to any form of human trafficking. To those that still make that choice: make no mistake, the Justice Department will use every lawful tool to uncover your illegal activity and bring you to justice.”</td>\n",

The subcommittee continues to explore ways to expand and improve training for federal, state, and local prosecutors and investigators; improve data collection of hate crimes; and to create even better partnerships with local law enforcement and affected communities.    “The full report of the Task Force is due in January, but there are actions we can take now, like continuing to aggressively prosecute those who violate an individuals’ civil rights. Most recently, the Justice Department cross-designated a Civil Rights Division prosecutor to assist in the trial of an Iowa man accused of murdering Kedarie Johnson, a transgender teenager. I was pleased to learn on November 3, 2017 that the trial resulted in a conviction, and the man now faces life in prison.   “The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that individuals can live without fear of being a victim of violent crime based on who they are, what they believe, or how they worship.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released a video statement today on the FBI’s newly announced 2015 hate crime statistics as well as on recent media reports of alleged hate crimes and harassment around the country.  The statement reminds individuals to report these incidents to both local law enforcement and the Justice Department in order to ensure that career investigators and prosecutors are able to enforce hate crime statutes at the local, state and federal level. The video can be viewed at here, and a transcript of the video is below: “Earlier this week, the FBI released its statistics on hate crimes committed in 2015.  These numbers should be deeply sobering for all Americans.  Among other alarming trends, the report showed a 67 percent increase in hate crimes committed against Muslim Americans.  It also showed increases in the number of hate crimes committed against Jewish people, African Americans, and LGBT individuals.  Overall, the number of reported hate crimes increased six percent – a number that does not account for the many hate crimes that may go unreported out of shame or fear. “Beyond these 2015 statistics, I know that many Americans are concerned by a spate of recent news reports about alleged hate crimes and harassment.  Some of these incidents have happened in schools.  Others have targeted houses of worship.  And some have singled out individuals for attacks and intimidation.  The FBI is assessing, in conjunction with federal prosecutors, whether particular incidents constitute violations of federal law.  We need you to continue to report these incidents to local law enforcement, as well as the Justice Department, so that our career investigators and prosecutors can take action to defend your rights.  You can find information about federal hate crimes laws – and other civil rights laws that the department enforces, including protections for students in schools – on our Civil Rights Division’s website.  Our site also contains resources for communities working to prevent and respond to hate crimes, as well. “Last month marked the seventh anniversary of one of those laws: the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  This landmark statute was named for two men who were killed for the most un-American of reasons – because they were different from their attackers – Matthew Shepard in his sexual orientation, and James Byrd Jr. in his race.  The law that bears their names significantly expanded our ability to combat hate crimes by adding new federal protections against crimes based on one’s gender identity, sexual orientation, gender, or disability status – protections that we have worked tirelessly to uphold in the last seven years. “But despite the tremendous progress we have made, we cannot lose sight of how much remains to be done.  Nearly two decades after Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. were brutally murdered simply for being who they were, we still have a long way to go to ensure that every American can live free from the fear of violence or harassment based what they look like, how they worship, or whom they love. “That work is not just about enforcing the law.  It’s about staying true to our highest ideals and most cherished principles.  It’s about making sure that all Americans receive the protection of the law.  And it’s about giving real meaning to our shared belief that all people are created equal. “Put simply, this work is the right – and just – thing to do.  And I want the American people to know that as long as that work is necessary, the Department of Justice will continue to carry it forward.  We will continue to enforce our nation’s hate crimes laws to the fullest extent possible.  We will continue to uphold our conviction that all men and women deserve to lead lives of safety and dignity.  And we will continue to champion the values of diversity and inclusion that have always been the bedrock of our nation’s progress, and that point the way to a brighter future.  Thank you.”</td>\n",

S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner of the Eastern District of California. According to court documents, on Dec. 19, 2012, Whittington shouted racist slurs at a Latino man outside the Latino man’s home in Oildale, California, and fired a sawed off shot gun in an attempt to intimidate and interfere with the victim’s occupancy of his home because of his race, color or national origin. This case is the product of an investigation by the FBI and the Kern County, California, Sheriff’s Office. Trial Attorney Samantha Trepel of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U. S. Attorney Brian K. Delaney of the Eastern District of California are prosecuting the case. If convicted, Whittington faces a maximum statutory penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Travis Reynolds, 21, of Baltimore, pleaded guilty today to one count of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which makes it a federal crime to damage the property of a reproductive health services facility because of the services offered there. The charge stems from incidents that occurred late in the evening on Feb. 24, 2016, and early in the morning on Feb. 25, 2016, when Reynolds and another man decided to vandalize a Baltimore area women’s health care clinic.  Reynolds spray-painted the words “Baby Killer,” “Kill Baby Here” and other graphic messages across the building where the clinic is located. During his guilty plea before U.S. Magistrate Judge Beth Gesner of the District of Maryland, Reynolds admitted that he vandalized the clinic because it offered abortion services.  At the time of his arrest, Reynolds admitted to police that he defaced the clinic’s doors, walls and windows because he thought that it would deter women from using the clinic. “The Justice Department will continue to aggressively enforce the FACE Act, which makes it a crime to intentionally damage a clinic because it offers reproductive health services,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “While people have a First Amendment right to peacefully express their views, they do not have a right to vandalize clinics in the hopes of deterring women from receiving lawful services that those facilities provide.” The case was investigated by the FBI and the Baltimore County Police Department.  The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Sanjay Patel of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, with assistance from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the District of Maryland.

supervisory correctional officer at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, pleaded guilty yesterday in connection with the beating of a handcuffed and shackled inmate, in addition to conspiring to cover up their misconduct by falsifying official records and lying to internal investigators about what happened.     James Savoy, 39, of Marksville, Louisiana, admitted during his plea hearing that he witnessed other officers using excessive force against the inmate and failed to intervene; that he conspired with other officers to cover up the beating by engaging in a variety of obstructive acts; and that he personally falsified official prison records to cover up the attack.   Scotty Kennedy, 48, of Beebe, Arkansas, and John Sanders, 30, of Marksville, Louisiana previously pleaded guilty in November 2016, and September 2017, for their roles in the beating and cover up.   “Every citizen has the right to due process and protection from unreasonable force, and correctional officers who violate these basic Constitutional rights must be held accountable for their egregious actions” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.  “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute correctional officers who violate the public’s trust by committing crimes and to covering up violations of federal criminal law.”   “Yesterday is another example of our office’s unwavering commitment to pursuing those who violate the federal criminal civil rights laws,” said Acting United States Attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana Corey Amundson. “We will continue to work closely with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the FBI to ensure that no one is above the law.”     This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Baton Rouge Resident Agency and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

                 A federal jury convicted Rick Lee Evans, 43, of Anniston, Alabama, today of aggravated sexual abuse of a child after a five-day trial, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama announced.  According to evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Evans sexually abused the child on multiple occasions during the 18 months that the child lived with him from May 2007 to December 2008.  Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division and the FBI’s Birmingham, Alabama, Division investigated the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.     \n",

indicted today and charged with multiple crimes involving travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors and child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Kenyen R. Brown of the Southern District of Alabama. Clarence Edward Evers Jr., aka Bud, a technology teacher employed by the Conecuh County, Alabama, Board of Education, was arrested on Feb. 11, 2016, and was charged today with five counts of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of attempted travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of production and attempted production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography, one count of receipt of child pornography, one count of access with intent to view child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. According to the indictment, Evers allegedly traveled to Thailand in the summers of 2010 through 2014 for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and allegedly attempted to make a similar trip in the spring of 2015.  During the 2014 trip, Evers also allegedly photographed his victims’ abuse and then transported the images back to the United States.  In addition, Evers allegedly had other images of child sexual exploitation on his computers and other electronic devices. The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  Evers is presumed innocent unless and until he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. ICE-HSI is investigating this case.  Trial Attorney James E. Burke IV of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean P. Costello and Maria E. Murphy of the Southern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

federal grand jury in Birmingham, Alabama, on charges related to the production of child pornography involving four minor victims, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E.

man at a Quinton, Alabama, restaurant, and for threatening another person who ordered Higgins to leave the restaurant due to his behavior, Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance for the Northern District of Alabama announced today.   Higgins, 28, was charged in a three count indictment returned yesterday by a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  The indictment charges him with one felony count and two misdemeanor counts of interference with a federally-protected activity.  The indictment alleges that on June 14, 2013, Higgins approached and threatened an African-American man at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse because the man was present at the restaurant with a white woman.  According to the indictment, another person ordered Higgins to leave the premises of the restaurant because of Higgins’ behavior toward the African-American man, after which Higgins allegedly shouted a threat to burn down the restaurant.  The indictment further alleges that Higgins threatened the person who had ordered him to leave the restaurant by painting graffiti on the restaurant’s exterior and fence.     If convicted of the felony count of the indictment, Higgins could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  For each of the misdemeanor charges, Higgins could face a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $200,000 fine.   This case is being investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin B. Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.     \n",

of Dothan, Ala., turned himself in and pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday, Dec. 6, 2013, to one count of conspiring to violate housing rights, the Justice Department announced today.  The information charging Smith was unsealed today.  The charge relates to his participation in a cross burning at the entrance to an African-American community in Ozark, Ala., on May 8, 2009, with a former KKK leader who was arrested and charged with a five-count indictment on Wednesday, Nov. 27, 2013. During his plea, Smith admitted that he and a co-conspirator agreed to burn a cross together in order to intimidate the neighborhood’s African-American residents.  Using materials from around his home, the co-conspirator constructed a wooden cross about six feet tall and wrapped cloth around the cross.  The co-conspirator loaded the cross into Smith’s truck, and, with Smith driving while the co-conspirator provided directions, the two men transported the cross to a predominantly African-American residential neighborhood.  They unloaded the cross at the entrance to the community, where the co-conspirator poured fuel on the cross, stood it up in view of several houses and set it on fire. “The defendant’s crime illustrates the damage hate crimes can do to entire communities, making people feel unsafe in their own homes,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division.  “We’d like to think these offenses are a thing of the past, but the reality is that they happen here in the 21st century.  The Justice Department is committed to stamping them out.” “This defendant not only committed a federal crime, but committed a contemptible action of hate,” said U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr.  “Citizens in the Middle District of Alabama should not and will not tolerate such actions.  I hope this prosecution sends a clear message that these hateful demonstrations will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Smith faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.  This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Dale County Sheriff’s Office and the Ozark Police Department.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerusha T. Adams of the Middle District of Alabama and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

guilty today to producing child pornography involving seven minor victims, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama.  Gregory Jerome Lee, 54, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, pleaded guilty to four counts of production of child pornography before U.S. District Judge Virginia Emerson Hopkins of the Northern District of Alabama.  Sentencing is set for April 12, 2017.   According to admissions made in connection with his guilty plea, from September 1996 through December 2003, Lee sexually abused at least seven different minors and frequently produced images and videos depicting his exploitation of these children.  From approximately September 1996 until August 2007, Lee and his co-conspirators used secret, password-protected chat rooms to discuss their interests in and real-life sexual abuse of children and to trade child pornography, Lee admitted.    The U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigated the case.  Trial Attorneys Amy E. Larson and Ralph Paradiso of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Fortune of the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case.   This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.    \n",

Bowdre of the Northern District of Alabama.  Sentencing is set for April 3, 2018.   According to admissions made in connection with his guilty plea, between Aug. 1, 1997, and Oct. 15, 1998, McCormack used a minor, born in or about 1992, to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of the conduct, by videotaping the minor urinating in a bathroom in his residence in Colbert County, Alabama.  McCormack was employed as a kindergarten teacher during a May 2016 search of his residence, which resulted in law enforcement discovering fewer than 25 images of nude and topless females believed to constitute child pornography and a suitcase containing young girls’ panties.    The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Fortune of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.   This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

Higgins, 28, a resident of Quinton, Alabama, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Madeline Haikala to two counts of federal civil rights violations, announced the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama. As part of the plea proceedings, Higgins admitted that on June 14, 2013, he approached and threatened an African-American man at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse, a restaurant in Quinton, Alabama, because the man was present at the restaurant with a white woman. Soon after, the couple left the bar. A manager at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse confronted Higgins because of his behavior toward the African-American man and ordered Higgins to leave the restaurant. As Higgins was being escorted from the bar, he used racial slurs, shouted a racial slur at the restaurant manager, and threatened to burn down the Alabama Rose Steakhouse. Later that evening, Higgins returned to the restaurant and threatened the restaurant manager by painting graffiti on the restaurant’s front exterior and fence. Sentencing in this case is set for January 9, 2015.\\n“Threatening an individual over their race or a business for its acceptance of others has no place in a civilized society,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Molly Moran for the Civil Rights Division. “The Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute those who seek to intimidate others with these types of hateful threats.” “Access to public places, like restaurants, has been at the core of the civil rights struggle,” said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama. “Unlike the lunch counters of the 1960s, the restaurant in this case welcomed and sought to protect the rights of its African American customer. In prosecuting this case, we make clear our commitment to enforcing the civil rights of individuals and the businesses who seek to serve all, without regard to the color of their skin.” This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin B. Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

             An Alabama man was sentenced today to 660 months in prison and a lifetime term of supervised release for his aggravated sexual abuse of a child under the age of 12, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Rick Lee Evans, 43, a truck driver from Talladega, Alabama, was convicted by a federal jury on Dec. 11, 2015, of one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child under 12.   According to the evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Trial evidence showed that from May 2007 to December 2008, while the child lived with Evans, he sexually abused the child on multiple occasions.  Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case. U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division and the FBI’s Birmingham, Alabama, Division investigated the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance for the Northern District of Alabama and FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard D. Shwein Jr. announced that a Talladega County, Ala., man was sentenced in federal court today for attempting to hire members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to murder an African-American neighbor Allen Wayne Densen Morgan, 29, of Munford, Ala., pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre on Oct. 24, 2013, to one count of using and causing someone else to use interstate facilities and travel with the intent to commit a murder-for-hire.  At today’s sentencing hearing, Judge Bowdre sentenced Morgan to serve 72 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Morgan previously admitted that in August 2013, he attempted to hire members of the KKK to murder his neighbor.  According to Morgan’s plea agreement, on Aug. 22, 2013, Morgan spoke on the phone with an undercover FBI agent, who identified himself as a KKK member.  The men arranged to meet three days later at an Oxford, Ala., motel to discuss payment for the murder.  In that phone conversation, Morgan used a racial slur to describe the man he wanted killed and bragged that he had just fired several shots toward the man to intimidate him.  Morgan also described, in detail, how he wanted the man to be “hung from a tree like a deer and gutted,” to have body parts cut off and to “die a slow, painful death.”  On August 25, Morgan met with FBI agents posing as members of the KKK.  Morgan offered a watch, a necklace and a gun as payment for the murder and gave explicit directions for the man’s torture and murder.  “The defendant attempted to have his neighbor tortured and murdered by the KKK,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuels.  “Today’s sentence demonstrates that the Justice Department will continue to aggressively prosecute those who act on their racial hatred by seeking to inflict such acts of violence on others.” “Mr. Morgan detailed his calculated desire to end his neighbor's life through the most brutal and heinous means,” said U.S. Attorney Vance. “Today's sentence reinforces that vigilantism is not acceptable in our society and we will prosecute that crime.” This case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pat Meadows and Brad Felton of the Northern District of Alabama and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney David Reese.   \n",

               An Anchorage, Alaska, man was sentenced for attempting to sexually exploit children in Cambodia over the course of four years and attempting to arrange a child sex tourism trip for himself and others to Cambodia, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen L. Loeffler of the District of Alaska.  Jason Jayavarman, 45, was sentenced yesterday to serve 216 months in prison and a lifetime term of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Sharon L. Gleason of the District of Alaska for his March 2015 conviction of attempted sexual exploitation of children and attempted travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place. The evidence presented at trial established that over the course of 12 trips to Cambodia between 2010 and his arrest in 2013, Jayavarman produced multiple videos of himself engaging in sexual acts with an individual who he believed to be a child.  Jayavarman then transported the recordings back to the United States.  According to trial evidence, Jayavarman also planned a trip for himself and others to Cambodia for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with children as young as 12 years old.  Trial evidence demonstrated that Jayavarman explained to one of the other potential travelers – who was an undercover FBI agent – how to groom a child for sex, avoid law enforcement detection and record high quality “mementos” of the sexual abuse.  Jayavarman’s child exploitation activities came to light following a concerned citizen’s anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers. The FBI and the Anchorage Police Department investigated the case.  Trial Attorney Ravi Sinha of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Audrey J. Renschen of the District of Alaska prosecuted the case.

supervised release for receiving and distributing child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen. L. Loeffler of the District of Alaska. Dr. Greg Alan Salard, 54, of Wrangell, Alaska, was found guilty on July 28, 2015, after a six-day trial before Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy M. Burgess of the District of Alaska, who also sentenced Salard late yesterday and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.  According to evidence presented at trial, between June and October 2014, an Internet Protocol address linked to Salard was used to share known child sexual exploitation files and a laptop computer seized from Salard’s home contained peer to peer software that was used to share one of the images identified during the investigation.  A forensic examination of the laptop uncovered evidence of hundreds of child sexual exploitation files, that multiple searches had been run on the laptop for a term associated with child sexual exploitation and that child sexual exploitation videos had been viewed on the computer.  The evidence also revealed that a program designed to erase or “wipe” computer files had been used multiple times, including on the morning the search warrant was executed. The FBI investigated the case, with assistance from the U.S. Forest Service; the Petersburg, Alaska, Police Department; the Wrangell Police Department; and the Juneau, Alaska, Police Department.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyle Reardon of the District of Alaska and Trial Attorney Leslie Williams Fisher of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) prosecuted the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

one year of supervised release for making telephonic threats to two medical clinics in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that provide reproductive health services.     On March 2, 2016, Harris pleaded guilty to two violations of 18 U.S.C. § 248(a)(1).  During his plea hearing, Harris admitted that on May 12, 2014, he made telephonic threats to two different health clinics in Minneapolis that provide reproductive health services.  In a call to the first clinic, Harris threatened to kill the recipient of the call with his bare hands and to cut the recipient’s head off with a band saw.  In a call to the second clinic, Harris told the recipient that he was going to kill the recipient and the recipient’s co-workers, and that he was going to travel to the clinic and shoot everyone present.  Harris further admitted that he made these threats because the recipient was and has been, and in order to intimidate the recipient and any other person from, obtaining and providing reproductive health services.  “This defendant threatened these clinic workers with death and brutality,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The department is pleased that the defendant accepted responsibility and will face consequences for his actions. The Department is committed to vigorously enforcing the civil rights of all individuals in this country.” “The violence threatened by this defendant against health care workers is unacceptable,” said United States Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota.  “This sentence should serve as a reminder to individuals who would engage in such threats that the federal government will prosecute these crimes.” This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Risa Berkower of the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice and Assistant U.S. Attorney Manda M. Sertich of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota.   \n",

                          WASHINGTON – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today rejected a challenge to the conviction of James Ford Seale, a former member of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi. Seale was convicted by a federal jury in Mississippi in 2007 and sentenced to three life terms in prison. The jury determined that Seale and other Klansmen conspired to abduct, interrogate, beat and eventually murder Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie Moore, both 19 years old at the time of their murders. Seale appealed his convictions, arguing that a 1972 amendment to the federal kidnapping statute changed the statute of limitations to five years. In September 2008, a three-judge panel agreed with Seale, overturning his convictions. The United States successfully urged the full court to rehear the case and, in the meantime, to keep Seale in jail. Today, a divided court upheld the trial court’s decision to deny Seale’s motion to dismiss the indictment based on the statute of limitations. The appeal will return to the original three-judge panel to resolve the remaining issues. \"We are pleased with today’s decision rejecting the argument that it was too late to bring Seale to justice,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Based on evidence presented at trial, the jury determined that on May 2, 1964, Seale and his accomplices abducted Dee and Moore and drove the two young men into the Homochitto National Forest in Franklin County, Miss., where the Klansmen beat the victims, interrogated them at gunpoint and bound the two men with duct tape. The Klansmen then drove the victims to Parker’s Landing in Warren County, Miss., passing through the state of Louisiana, where the Klansmen secured Dee and Moore to heavy objects and threw them into the Old Mississippi River, drowning them. Seale is the first and only individual to be convicted for participating in the kidnapping and murders. The conviction of James Ford Seale is the result of the investigative work of the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, the Adam’s County Sheriff’s Office and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety also assisted in the investigation. This case was prosecuted by Dunn Lampton, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, and Special Litigation counsel Paige Fitzgerald and trial attorney Eric Gibson, both of the Civil Rights Division. The appeal was handled by attorney Tovah R. Calderon, also of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",

        WASHINGTON – David Dean, 43, of Peoria, Ariz., was sentenced today to 180 monthsin prison and a lifetime of supervised release for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton for the Western District of Pennsylvania and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton.          “The members of this criminal enterprise committed the most unthinkable of crimes – they trafficked in chilling images of children and infants being brutally, sexually abused.   And, they used a social networking website to distribute these images so that they could reach as many other like-minded individuals as they could,” said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.   “Our children, who are the most vulnerable and innocent in our society, deserve every measure of protection we can give them.   As this prosecution shows, we will use every tool we have to attack and dismantle these illegal child exploitation networks.”          “ This prosecution also illustrates the ripe environment for child predators that exists though the internet.  The defendants in this case found kinship online, validating their shared desire to engage in sex with children, and to seek sexual gratification through sharing horrific and degrading images of children,” said U.S. Attorney Hickton.  “We must respond to this threat with the full force of federal law enforcement and its many partners across agencies, jurisdictions, state lines, and national borders.  I am committed to this effort, and we will not stop until we eradicate this evil.”       “Possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime,” said ICE Director Morton. “Those who engage in this criminal behavior should be forewarned that ICE, along with our law enforcement partners, will use every tool at our disposal to end the sexual exploitation of our children and keep them safe wherever they live.”          On June 17, 2010, Dean pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Arthur A. Schwab in Pittsburgh to one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.  According to court documents and proceedings, Dean and others distributed images and videos of children being sexually abused to other members of an international group that had restricted membership and was formed on a social networking website.  Members of the group distributed to one another thousands of sexually explicit images and videos of children, many of which graphically depicted prepubescent, male children, including some infants, being sexually abused and sometimes sodomized or subjected to bondage.          Seven co-defendants have previously pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison as a result of this investigation.        This case was investigated by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and the High Technology Investigative Unit of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS).  Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig W. Haller and CEOS Trial Attorney Andrew McCormack prosecuted the case.       This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

                            WASHINGTON –Frankie Maybee, 20, of Green Forest, Ark., was convicted today by a federal jury today of five counts of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime, announced the Justice Department.  This is the first conviction at trial for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.    Maybee faces a maximum of 55 years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000 per violation. On May 16, 2011, co-defendant Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime in connection with this matter.  Evidence presented at trial established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Maybee and Popejoy conspired to and did threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck.  When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims, and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims.  Maybee, driving his truck, rammed into the victims’ car repeatedly, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite.  As a result of Maybee and his co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “The defendants targeted five men because they were Hispanic, and today’s verdict shows that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously prosecuting individuals who perform acts of hate because of someone’s race or national origin,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.  “We will continue to use the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and every other tool in our law enforcement arsenal, to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever they occur.” “ We thank the jury for their careful consideration, and for their verdict. It is horrific that acts of violence are committed against complete strangers because of their race,” Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “In this case, five Hispanic men stopped to fill up their car with gas and were violently run off the road, causing severe injuries and nearly causing death to one of them. In the Western District of Arkansas, we will continue to prosecute acts of violence that are motivated by hatred of another’s race. ” This case was investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville, Ark., Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra E. Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON - Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark., pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., to one count of civil rights conspiracy, one count of interference with housing rights due to race and one count of possession of an unregistered firearm/destructive device for his involvement in the Jan. 14, 2011, racially motivated firebombing of the home of an interracial couple in Hardy, Ark. Dodson, along with Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, of Waldron; Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy, Ark.; and Wendy Treybig, 31, of Evening Shade, were indicted in April by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the racially motivated firebombing and their attempts to obstruct a federal investigation. During the plea proceedings, Dodson admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, while at a party at Barnwell’s house in Evening Shade, he, Murphy, Hammond and Barnwell devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. Dodson then drove all four men from Barnwell’s residence to the victims’ house in Hardy. When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. They damaged the victims’ house, however, the victims were not injured. “The victims’ home was attacked and their safety threatened because of their race. Such violence and intimidation has no place in our society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts of hate.” “Today’s plea begins the final chapter in a terrible story begun less than a year ago on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, in a small Northeast Arkansas community,” said Christopher R. Thyer, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  “Racially motivated violence, more than any other type, tears at the very fabric of what makes America and Arkansas great.  We should be celebrating our diversity rather than committing acts of violence because of it.  When it occurs, my office will vigorously prosecute it.” Dodson faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for April 6, 2012. Barnwell, Murphy, Hammond and Treybig have already pleaded guilty for their involvement in this matter. This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                                                                        WASHINGTON - Jason Walter Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., to charges related to his involvement in the Jan. 14, 2011, racially motivated firebombing of the home of a mixed-race couple in Hardy, Ark. Barnwell pleaded guilty to one count of civil rights conspiracy and one count of use of fire during the commission of a felony in connection with the incident. Barnwell also pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon for illegally possessing a firearm on March 16, 2011, the Department of Justice announced today. Barnwell, along with Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, also of Waldron; Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy; and Wendy Treybig, 31, of Evening Shade, were indicted in April 2011 by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the racially motivated firebombing and subsequent attempt to obstruct a federal investigation. During the plea proceedings, Barnwell admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, while at a party at his house, he, Murphy, Hammond and Dodson devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. Thereafter, all four men drove from Barnwell’s residence to the victims’ house in Hardy. When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. The victims’ house sustained some damage; however, the victims were not injured. Barnwell also admitted to illegally possessing a firearm after he had been convicted of a felony. “We simply will not tolerate racially-motivated violence in this country,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such heinous acts.” “This joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; along with the Arkansas State Police; the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments; and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices demonstrates how seriously all levels and branches of law enforcement consider these acts of prejudice, intolerance, and intimidation,” said Christopher R. Thyer, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. “ We are committed to protect the civil rights of all citizens of the Eastern District of Arkansas.” Barnwell faces a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for Dec. 20, 2011. Murphy, Hammond and Treybig previously pleaded guilty for their involvement in this matter. Gary Dodson is scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 25, 2011. This case was investigated by the Little Rock Division of the Federal FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                                                    WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice today announced that Paul Schlesselman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a presidential candidate, and one count of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Schlesselman faces a sentence of 10 years under the plea agreement. A sentencing date of April 15, 2010, was set by Judge J. Daniel Breen, who is presiding over the case in Jackson, Tenn. Schlesselman of West Helena, Ark., admitted to conspiring to murder dozens of people, with a focus on murdering African-Americans. He further acknowledged that he intended to culminate his killing spree by assassinating then-Senator Barack Obama, who was a presidential candidate at the time. \"Despite great civil rights progress, hate-fueled violence remains all too common in our country, as illustrated by this unthinkable conspiracy,\" said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Tragedy was averted thanks to the capable work of the Crockett County Sheriff’s Department and their willingness to work with the ATF, the Secret Service and the FBI.\" \"Crimes committed against individuals because of their race will not be tolerated,\" said Lawrence J. Laurenzi, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. \"I commend the work of the investigative agencies in thwarting what could have been a series of tragic events.\" Schlesselman admitted that beginning on or about Sept. 1, 2008, and continuing until Oct. 22, 2008, he conspired to transport firearms and ammunition in interstate commerce, steal firearms from a licensed firearms dealer and transport in interstate commerce a short-barreled shotgun, all for the purpose of committing murders, robberies and burglaries. Schlesselman further acknowledged that on Oct. 20, 2008, he unlawfully transported an unregistered short barreled shotgun and a .357 magnum caliber handgun across state lines for the purpose of committing felonies, including racially targeted murders. Schlesselman also admitted that on Oct. 23, 2008, he threatened to kill and inflict bodily harm on President Barack Obama, who was a presidential candidate at the time. The case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Secret Service; the FBI; and the Crockett County Sheriff’s Office. The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Larry Laurenzi, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Powell and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Jonathan Skrmetti.   \n",

Coffee, along with co-defendants, Tony Branscum, 25, and Bradley Branscum, 23, also of Salado, were indicted in November 2010, by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other related federal charges stemming from their participation in the cross burning. Tony and Bradley Branscum, who are cousins, pleaded guilty last week for their roles in the cross burning. Coffee admitted in court that on the night of Aug. 28, 2010, he, along with his co-defendants, devised a plan to burn a cross in the yard of an African-American in the Salado community. Thereafter, Tony Branscum constructed a wooden cross in a workshop behind his house. The men then covered the cross in gasoline-soaked clothing and Brad Branscum drove them and the cross to the victim’s residence. Upon arriving at the residence, Coffee propped up the cross on a satellite dish and ignited it. “The burning cross is an unmistakable symbol of bigotry and hate, and to use it to threaten a person with violence because of his race is intolerable in this nation,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “We will continue to aggressively prosecute hate crimes of this kind.” Coffee faces up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000. This case was investigated by the Little Rock, Ark., Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today that Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, Ark., pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. This is the first conviction for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.   Information presented during the plea hearing established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Popejoy admitted that he was part of a conspiracy to threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck. When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims. The co-conspirator rammed into the victims' car, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite. As a result of the co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “James Byrd, Jr. and Matthew Shepard were brutally murdered more than a decade ago, and today the first defendant is convicted for a hate crime under the critical new law enacted in their names,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “It is unacceptable that violent acts of hate committed because of someone’s race continue to occur in 2011, and the department will continue to use every available tool to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever and wherever they occur.  “It is terrible and disturbing that violence motivated by hatred of another’s race continues to occur,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “We are committed to prosecuting such crimes in the Western District of Arkansas.” If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.   \n",

civil rights charges related to a conspiracy to drive a woman and her children from their home because they associated with African-Americans. Nix was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, three years of post-incarceration supervision, a fine of $5,000, and a $200 special assessment. Nix pleaded guilty on July 10, 2009, to two felony civil rights charges for conspiring to violate, and violating, the civil rights of the victims. In the plea proceedings and documents filed in court, Nix admitted that in June 2008, he conspired with others to force the victims to leave Donaldson because they associated with African-Americans. Specifically, on June 15, 2008, Nix and the others agreed to construct a cross and burn it in front of the victims’ home. Nix was present for and aided in the construction of the cross. Then, on June 21, 2008, Nix and others drove the cross to the victims’ home. Nix and the others erected the cross in front of the victims’ home and attempted to set it on fire. Nix admitted that he understood that the purpose of burning the cross was to threaten and intimidate the victims, and that it was not intended as a joke or prank. Nix’s co-conspirators, Jacob A. Wingo, Richard W. Robins, Clayton D. Morrison and Darren E. McKim, pleaded guilty in September 2009, for their roles in the conspiracy. Sentencing for Wingo, Robins, Morrison and McKim has been scheduled for Dec. 7, 2009. \"Driven by bigotry and hate, the defendants in this case threatened a young family with violence simply because they associated with persons of another race. Threats of this kind have no place in America,\" said Assistant Attorney General Perez. \"Aggressive prosecution of hate crimes is a top priority for the Civil Rights Division, and the defendant’s conviction should send a message to others who would carry out similar criminal acts that they will be brought to justice.\" Special Agents from the FBI’s Little Rock Field Office investigated this matter. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Quinn for the Western District of Arkansas, along with Special Litigation Counsel Gerard Hogan and Trial Attorney Benjamin Hawk of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.   \n",

Department announced that Paul Schlesselman was sentenced today on federal charges for conspiring to murder dozens of African-Americans, including then-Senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama, because of their race. On Jan. 14, 2010, Schlesselman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, one count of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a presidential candidate, and one count of possessing a firearm. Today, U.S. District Judge J. Daniel Breen sentenced Schlesselman to 10 years in prison and three years supervised release.  Schlesselman of West Helena, Ark., admitted that he conspired to murder several people, with a focus on targeting African-Americans. He stated that beginning on or about Sept. 1, 2008, and continuing until Oct. 22, 2008, he conspired to transport firearms and ammunition in interstate commerce, steal firearms from a licensed firearm dealer and transport in interstate commerce a short-barreled shotgun, all for the purpose of committing murders, robberies and burglaries. Schlesselman acknowledged that he intended to culminate his racially-targeted killing spree by assassinating then-Senator Obama. \"Our nation has made great progress in advancing civil rights, but this unthinkable conspiracy is a reminder that hate-fueled violence continues to be a very real problem in so many communities,\" said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Tragedy was averted thanks to the capable work of the Crockett County Sheriff’s Department and their willingness to work with the ATF, the Secret Service and the FBI.\" \"Crimes committed against individuals because of their race will not be tolerated,\" said Lawrence J. Laurenzi, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. \"I commend the work of the investigative agencies in thwarting what could have been a series of tragic events.\" This case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Crockett County Sheriff’s Office. The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Larry Laurenzi, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Powell, and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Jonathan Skrmetti.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice announced today that Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark., was sentenced in Little Rock, Ark., for his involvement in firebombing the residence of an interracial couple. On Aug. 26, 2011, Barnwell pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the civil rights of a resident of Hardy, Ark., and to using fire in the commission of that offense. Barnwell also pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. District Judge Billy Roy Wilson sentenced Barnwell to 20 years in prison for the three counts. During his plea, Barnwell admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, he hosted a party where he and three other men, Jake Murphy, Dustin Hammond and Gary Dodson, devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. The men then went to the victims’ house in Hardy and when they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. The Molotov cocktails ignited and damaged the victims’ house; however, the victims fortunately were not injured. Murphy and Hammond have already pleaded guilty to civil rights violations for their role in this incident. Both defendants received sentences of 54 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. In June 2011, Wendy Treybig, who co-hosted the party on Jan. 14, 2011, with Barnwell, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. She was sentenced on Dec.13, 2011, to 21 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Gary Dodson pleaded guilty on Dec.7, 2011, and will be sentenced on April 6, 2011. “This defendant not only committed acts of race-based violence, but recruited others to commit these hate-filled crimes as well. There is no place in our society for criminal acts such as these,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts.” This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Henry Leventis and Cindy Chung of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                      The Department of Justice announced today that Gary Dodson, 33, of Waldron, Ark., was sentenced in Little Rock for his involvement in firebombing the residence of an interracial couple. On Dec. 7, 2011, Dodson pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the civil rights, criminal interference with housing rights due to race and possession of an unregistered firearm/destructive device. District Judge Billy Roy Wilson sentenced Dodson to 15 years in prison and 3 years of supervised release for the three counts of conviction. During his plea, Dodson admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, he attended a party where he and three other men, Jake Murphy, Dustin Hammond and Jason Barnwell, devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. Dodson then drove the other men to purchase gas for the firebomb and then Dodson drove everyone to the victims’ house in Hardy, Ark. When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. They damaged the victims’ house; however, no one was injured. Murphy and Hammond previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to and violating the civil rights of the victim. Both received sentences of 54 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. In June 2011, Wendy Treybig, who co-hosted the party on Jan. 14, 2011, with Barnwell, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. She was sentenced on Dec. 13, 2011, to 21 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. Jason Barnwell pleaded guilty on Aug. 26, 2011, and was sentenced on Jan. 27, 2012 to 20 years incarceration. “With today’s sentencing, we can finally close the book on this terrible incident of racial hatred,” stated Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez. “The sentence reflects the gravity of these kinds of crimes. The Civil Rights Division will continue to pursue justice in hate crimes such as these, where victims are targeted because of the color of their skin.” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas Christopher R. Thyer said, “The very strength we have in our communities is a result of the diversity of its people. Those who perpetrate crimes against others solely because of racial differences will find, as these four defendants have, that there is a price to pay. The laws that protect our communities leave no tolerance for hate crimes.” This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Jus tice Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                             WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today the arrest of Sean Popejoy, 19, and Frankie Maybee, 20, both of Green Forest, Ark., on charges related to a racially-motivated assault on five Hispanic men. A federal grand jury in the Western District of Arkansas returned an indictment on April 5, 2011, charging Popejoy and Maybee with federal hate crime charges and conspiracy to commit a federal hate crime. According to the indictment, Popejoy and Maybee have been charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009. Specifically, the indictment alleges that on June 20, 2010, the defendants yelled anti-Latino epithets at the victims while at a gas station parking lot. When the victims drove away, the defendants chased after them in the defendants’ truck. The defendants eventually caught up to the victims’ car and repeatedly rammed their truck into the victims’ car, causing the victims’ car to go off the road, overturn and ignite. All five of the victims were physically injured as a result of the defendants’ actions. If convicted, the defendants face maximum penalties of 10 years in prison on each of the civil rights charges. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office. The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.   \n",

Ark., were sentenced for charges relating to their roles in burning a cross in the yard of an African-American resident on Aug. 28, 2010. Tony Branscum was sentenced on Jan. 20, 2012, to 18 months in prison. Bradley Branscum and Curtis Coffee were sentenced today. Bradley Branscum was sentenced to seven months in prison and Curtis Coffee was sentenced today to 18 months in prison. On Aug. 28, 2010, the three men and a juvenile constructed a cross, placed it in the yard of an African-American resident of Salado and lit it on fire. The defendants then drove away. The resident did not suffer injury, and his home was not damaged. All three men had previously pleaded guilty in this case to interfering with the housing rights of another. “The defendants acted to instill fear because of the victim’s race,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Department of Justice remains committed to protecting our communities from such violence and will continue to aggressively prosecute these acts.” This case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by AUSA John Ray White, of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Trial Attorney Cindy Chung of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",

                                                                                   WASHINGTON – Frankie Maybee, 20, and Sean Popejoy, 19, both of Green Forest, Ark., were sentenced for their roles in committing federal hate crimes, announced the Justice Department.  These are the first defendants to be sentenced under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009. Maybee was sentenced today to 135 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Popejoy, who testified against Maybee, was sentenced yesterday to 48 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. Maybee and Popejoy were also sentenced to pay $5,440 in restitution to the victims, jointly and severally. Maybee was convicted on May 19, 2011, by a federal jury of five counts of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. Popejoy pleaded guilty on May 16, 2011, to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. Evidence presented at trial established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Maybee and Popejoy targeted five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot. Though Maybee and Popejoy did not know the men and the five did not do or say anything to provoke them, Maybee and Popejoy yelled racial epithets at the men and told them to “go back to Mexico.” When the victims drove away, the co-conspirators pursued them in Maybee’s truck.  When Maybee and Popejoy caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims, and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims.  Maybee, driving his truck, rammed into the victims’ car repeatedly, causing the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite.  The victims were badly injured and one of the victims sustained life-threatening injuries. “The facts of this case shock the conscience. Five men were almost killed for no reason other than the fact that they are Hispanic. The Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act allowed us to bring these men to justice in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “These sentences send a clear message that the Justice Department will aggressively prosecute those who perpetrate violent acts of hate.” “Acts of violence that occur simply because of how someone looks are horrific,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “The five victims in this case were targeted because they are Hispanic. That is reprehensible. We thank the jury – 12 individuals from communities across Northern Arkansas - for their careful consideration of the evidence and for holding the defendants accountable for their actions. We hope that acts like this never occur. However, if they do, we will vigorously prosecute them.” “Hate crimes have wide-ranging impact, as their perpetrators attack the victim and intimidate entire communities,” stated FBI Little Rock, Ark., Special Agent-in-Charge Valerie Parlave.   “The FBI will continue to collaborate with our state and local partners to investigate and provide important training to address violent hate crimes that are bias-motivated.  We will also work with our community partners, such as the Arkansas Civil Rights Working Group, to develop strategies to address and reduce civil rights abuses.” This case was investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville, Ark., Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Edward Chung and Cindy Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra E. Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.   \n",

14, 2011, firebombing of the home of an interracial couple in Hardy, Ark., the Department of Justice announced. Treybig, along with Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade; Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, of Waldron; and Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy, Ark., were indicted in April by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the firebombing and subsequent cover-up. Murphy and Hammond have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Treybig admitted in court that she lied to FBI agents about her knowledge of what happened on the night of the incident. Treybig also admitted that she urged a friend to provide to the FBI a false story that would serve as an alibi for her co-defendants. “Threatening a couple with violence because of their race will not be tolerated in our country,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute individuals that violate the rights of others because of race. Treybig faces up to 20 years in prison. Barnwell and Dodson are scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 25, 2011. This case was investigated by the Little Rock, Ark., Field Office of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Henry Leventis of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",

Terry R. Means to 14 months in federal prison, following his guilty plea in February 2011 to a hate crime charge stemming from an arson of a children’s playground at the Dar El-Eman Islamic Center in Arlington in July 2010, the Justice Department announced today. Glaspell admitted that he set fire to playground equipment at the mosque as part of a series of ethnically-motivated acts directed at individuals of Arab or Middle Eastern descent associated with the mosque.  Glaspell further admitted that he stole and damaged mosque property, threw used cat litter at the front door of the mosque and shouted racial or ethnic slurs at individuals of Arab or Middle Eastern descent at the mosque on multiple occasions. Judge Means ordered that Glaspell, who has been on bond, surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on Nov. 21, 2011. “The defendant targeted Arab-Americans at a mosque where families worship peacefully and children play,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to vigorously prosecuting hate crimes against all persons and incidents of this kind will not be tolerated in our country.” “Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to build places of worship and assemble, free from discrimination,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. “This office will continue to prosecute those who commit such reprehensible acts of hatred.” This case was investigated by Arlington Police Department and the FBI.  It was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Victor Boutros from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Lewis of the Northern District of Texas, with assistance from the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office.   \n",

                A Stafford, Virginia, man who serves as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army was sentenced today to serve 240 months in prison for production of child pornography and attempted coercion and enticement of a minor using social media and instant messaging apps. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI’s Washington Field Office made the announcement.  Steven Jon Frederiksen, 42, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee of the Eastern District of Virginia, who also ordered him to serve a 20 year term of supervised release.  On Aug. 2, 2016, Frederiksen pleaded guilty to one count of production of child pornography and one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. In November 2015, the FBI received notification that Frederiksen, at the time an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), was utilizing his government-issued laptop to engage in the production of child pornography.  Frederiksen admitted in connection with his plea agreement that he used online chat programs, including Kik, to entice at least four minor girls, ranging in age from 14 to 17, to produce child pornography via the internet, which he then organized and saved in an online cloud storage account.  He attempted to do this with at least two other minor girls.  The defendant also possessed additional images of child pornography and exchanged child pornography with other individuals online. The FBI’s Washington Field Office investigated the case with assistance from the Army Criminal Investigative Command in Fort Belvoir.  Trial Attorneys James E. Burke IV and Lauren Britsch of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) prosecuted the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

announced that its Civil Rights Division is partnering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s U.S. Fire Administration on this year’s Arson Awareness Week, May 7-13, with a focus on Preventing Arson at Houses of Worship. There were an average of 103 arsons of houses of worship per year from 2000 to 2015.  Half of all reported fires at houses of worship turn out to involve arson. The Department of Justice enforces a number of federal statutes protecting places of worship from attack, including 18 U.S.C. § 247, known as the Church Arson Prevention Act, which was passed in the 1990s in response to a sharp increase in church arsons.  That law makes it a federal crime to target religious property because of the religion or race of the congregation.  In February of this year, the Department indicted an Idaho man under § 247 alleging that he set fire to a Catholic Church in Bonner’s Ferry in April 2016.  In 2013, an Indiana man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for setting a fire at the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. FEMA and the Department of Justice have produced a number of materials to help congregations, community organizations and local law enforcement and fire safety officials to increase arson awareness and hold events highlighting proactive steps that can be taken to try to reduce house of worship arson.  These materials are available at the Arson Awareness Week homepage, www.usfa.fema.gov/aaw.  “Arson against houses of worship is a serious crime that the Department of Justice is committed to prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “But our role as prosecutors, while critically important, only comes after the fact when the damage is already done.  That is why we encourage communities and local officials to take proactive steps to increase public awareness of the problem and measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of house of worship arson.” Further information about hate crimes, including arsons against on places of worship, is available at the Civil Rights Division hate crimes page, https://www.justice.gov/crt/hate-crimes-0.   \n",

Brotherhood member and inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Seagoville, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor after pleading guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act stemming from his assault of a fellow inmate, whom he believed to be gay, the Department of Justice announced. Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",
       "683      WASHINGTON – Attorney General Eric Holder today honored 52 prosecutors, law enforcement partners and victim advocates in 13 communities for their     leadership protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation. The awards were presented at the 2011 National Strategy Conference on Combating Child Exploitation in San Jose, Calif.       Attorney General Eric Holder has made one of the department’s four key priorities the protection of those most vulnerable – children, the elderly, and victims of hate crimes, human trafficking and exploitation.          “Through their work in urban, rural and tribal communities – and through cutting-edge online efforts – these individuals are advancing bold, innovative and collaborative solutions to keep our children safe from all forms of exploitation and abuse,” said Attorney General Holder. “By focusing on prevention and intervention, as well as proven enforcement and prosecution strategies, these award recipients are strengthening our ability to protect children in need and at risk, and to bring offenders to justice.”‪       Focused on protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation, the conference held this week in San Jose is bringing together more than 1,000 investigators, agents and prosecutors from all levels of government to receive state-of-the-art instruction in investigative techniques, court room advocacy, digital forensics, behavioral profiling, victim advocacy and community outreach.        The conference is sponsored by the department’s Project Safe Childhood Initiative and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Overall Partnership Coalition to the    San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force   The group of 20 members and affiliates are honored for their efforts in combating child exploitation crimes and promoting safer and more secure communities throughout the Southern District of California.       The San Diego (ICAC) Task Force employs a number of successful strategies to combat child exploitation, which include: training across jurisdictions on topics of mutual interest; cross-designated state law enforcement offices as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals; regular meetings with full and part-time members; and an emphasis on coordination between the district attorney’s office and U.S. Attorney’s office.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Community Outreach Efforts to    three prosecutors and a community relations officer in the Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney’s Office for the launch of their effort, “Internet Safety—It’s Not Just the Computer Anymore.” Since its launch in January 2010, the program has held discussions on Project Safe Childhood and Internet safety with more than 2,500 educators, parents and students.   The program’s continued growth and development includes a total of 12 Assistant U.S. Attorneys making presentations, in both English and Spanish, to teachers, school administrators, parents and youth.         The four award winners from the Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney’s Office   are Robert Stabe, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division; Sherri Zack, Assistant U.S. Attorney; Megan Paulson, Assistant U.S. Attorney; and Rob Barnes, Community Relations Coordinator. They are being honored for their launch of, “Internet Safety—It’s Not Just the Computer Anymore.”        Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Multi-Agency Operation to four Washington, D.C., law enforcement officials.   The four award winners are Timothy Palchak, Detective for the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department; Chadwick M. Elgersma, Associate Division Counsel of the FBI; Scott Schelble, Relief Supervisor for the National Capital Response Squad of the FBI; and Keith Becker, Trial Attorney for the Child Exploitation/Obscenity Section of the Justice Department.          The awardees are honored for their work in a series of child pornography, enticing and traveler cases, which led to the rescues of four child victims from three separate homes. The prosecutions began as a single distribution of child pornography case which, on account of the extraordinary efforts by these four individuals, resulted in the successful prosecution of six sexual offenders.   Four of the offenders were “hands-on” child sexual abusers who produced child pornography in four jurisdictions.   The offenders were sentenced to lengthy prison terms ranging from 15 to more than 27 years in prison.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Multi-Agency Operation to three North Carolina and Massachusetts law enforcement officials.   The three award winners are E. Michael Smith Jr., Special Agent for the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; Gregory D. Squire, Special Agent for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Boston; and Joe Exum Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.       The awardees are honored for their work which led to the rescue of a six-year-old child exploitation victim and successful prosecution of the sex offender.   In collaboration with state, local and federal authorities, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina prosecuted and convicted a sex offender for exploitation of a six-year-old child, obtaining the maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.   While the sentence is significant, the most compelling aspect of the case is the apparent seamlessness with which a federal agent in Boston, coordinated with a state law enforcement agent in North Carolina, who in turn worked with state, federal and local law enforcement and prosecutors to follow through on the lead.   This group exhibited exceptional cooperation and a swift response so that a child in rural North Carolina could be rescued quickly.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Superior Performance in Victim Services to    Felice Weiler, the Victim and Witness Specialist for the U.S. Attorney’s office of the Northern District of Illinois, for her outstanding work on behalf of victims in the prosecution of a sex offender.       Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Prevention Strategy to Tommy Loftis, Law Enforcement Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Alabama for his presentation, “The Hidden Dangers of the Digital Age,” promoting child Internet safety.

Through close partnerships, shared resources and tireless work, the group’s efforts have resulted in the indictment of more than 16 cases, charging more than 25 defendants for the domestic sex trafficking of minors.   In 2010, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Southern Florida had approximately five cases proceed to trial involving the sex trafficking of minors.   Despite the many significant challenges faced by the prosecution teams, all defendants were found guilty.          Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Prevention Strategy to nine Ohio law enforcement officials affiliated with the     Franklin County, Ohio, Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force.

Hunter.       The awardees are honored for their work in combating child exploitation crimes throughout the Southern District of Ohio.   Established in May of 2009, the Franklin County ICAC Task Force has demonstrated innovation and a consistent ability to adapt its techniques and practices to aggressively target child exploitation offenders in Central Ohio for arrest and prosecution.   The ICAC employs several innovative strategies to combat child exploitation, including the training of multiple officers in computer forensics, partnering with federal agencies, cross-deputizing task force officers as federal agents and coordinating a prosecution strategy with the U.S. Attorney’s Office.     Its successes include arresting more than 180 child exploitation defendants – including nine repeat offenders – executing more than 150 search warrants, identifying 10 child victims and referring 27 cases for federal prosecution.          Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Interdiction Strategy to two U.S. postal inspectors.   The award winners are William E.S. Beaty, Postal Inspector for the Seattle Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Gary Nork, Postal Inspector for the Phoenix Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.       The two awardees are honored for their work to ensure that a sex offender would not exploit children through the Internet and U.S. Mail. Working together, these two postal inspectors from two different states not only devised a strategy to identify the suspect and interdict the communications, but also secured the prosecution of the sex offender.   Within 48 hours of receiving a complaint from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, these postal inspectors acted to rescue a 12-year-old boy from a dangerous predator.            Attorney General Holder presented the award for Outstanding Local Prosecutor’s Office to Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff for his efforts in combating child exploitation crimes and promoting safer and more secure communities throughout the state of Utah.       Led by Utah Attorney General Mark L.

                                                                                                                           Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the following proclamation commemorating January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month: “Human trafficking is a nationwide public health and civil rights crisis. Its victims are everywhere: at truck stops, in cities, in rural areas, and in suburbs, and who now total an unconscionable 25 million victims globally according to some estimates. That means 25 million human beings—parents, siblings, and children—have been coerced into a commercial sex act, forced into labor, or exploited because they desperately seek a better life. It is a priority of the Department of Justice to combat this depraved and predatory behavior through swift and aggressive enforcement of our nation’s laws to bring traffickers to justice and restore the lives of victims and survivors. “The Justice Department’s U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), other federal agencies, and our state, local, and tribal partners, are on the front lines, leading our shared fight against human trafficking in all its forms.  These entities are supported by the Department’s Civil Rights Division which is home to a team of dedicated investigators and prosecutors—the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit (the HTPU)—tasked with bringing human traffickers to justice and vindicating the rights of their victims. Additionally, the Department’s Criminal Division includes the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), which is committed to harnessing expertise in attacking the technological and systemic challenges that are involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, as well as other specialized prosecution teams who bring expertise in organized crime and money laundering. “Our efforts have produced high-impact prosecutions to dismantle transnational organized human trafficking enterprises, have launched interagency anti-trafficking initiatives with unprecedented momentum, and have vindicated the rights and freedoms of countless victims and survivors.  “These efforts resulted in the conviction of nearly 500 defendants in trafficking cases in fiscal year 2017, and making $47 million available to help trafficking survivors.  Last fall, the FBI—along with state and local task forces and international law enforcement partners—recovered 84 minors and arrested 120 traffickers, as part a single week-long operation. However, we are keenly aware that many challenges lie ahead and we are committed to taking our efforts to the next level. “In his Presidential Proclamation, President Trump asked us to ‘recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement’ and to ‘pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking.’ In the spirit of the President’s request, the Justice Department is hosting a Human Trafficking Summit in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 2018, two days before Super Bowl LII.  The Super Bowl provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the surge in commercial sex activity around major sporting events, and of our commitment to finding and protecting sex trafficking victims who are at risk of being compelled, coerced, or exploited as minors in that context. “The Human Trafficking Summit will be led by Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand and will convene law enforcement, victim support organizations, and the business community to focus on enhancing the strong partnerships behind all successful anti-trafficking efforts and identifying opportunities to increase collaboration and coordination as we take on new challenges. “There is no room in a civilized society for those who choose to violate an individual’s rights and freedoms by subjecting them to any form of human trafficking. To those that still make that choice: make no mistake, the Justice Department will use every lawful tool to uncover your illegal activity and bring you to justice.”   \n",

                                    Attorney General Jeff Sessions released the following statement on the FBI’s announcement of the 2016 Hate Crimes Statistics:   “No person should have to fear being violently attacked because of who they are, what they believe, or how they worship.   “In June, the Hate Crimes Subcommittee of the Justice Department’s Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety met with representatives from affected communities. The subcommittee continues to explore ways to expand and improve training for federal, state, and local prosecutors and investigators; improve data collection of hate crimes; and to create even better partnerships with local law enforcement and affected communities.    “The full report of the Task Force is due in January, but there are actions we can take now, like continuing to aggressively prosecute those who violate an individuals’ civil rights. Most recently, the Justice Department cross-designated a Civil Rights Division prosecutor to assist in the trial of an Iowa man accused of murdering Kedarie Johnson, a transgender teenager. I was pleased to learn on November 3, 2017 that the trial resulted in a conviction, and the man now faces life in prison.   “The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that individuals can live without fear of being a victim of violent crime based on who they are, what they believe, or how they worship.”   \n",

              Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released a video statement today on the FBI’s newly announced 2015 hate crime statistics as well as on recent media reports of alleged hate crimes and harassment around the country.  The statement reminds individuals to report these incidents to both local law enforcement and the Justice Department in order to ensure that career investigators and prosecutors are able to enforce hate crime statutes at the local, state and federal level. The video can be viewed at here, and a transcript of the video is below: “Earlier this week, the FBI released its statistics on hate crimes committed in 2015.  These numbers should be deeply sobering for all Americans.  Among other alarming trends, the report showed a 67 percent increase in hate crimes committed against Muslim Americans.  It also showed increases in the number of hate crimes committed against Jewish people, African Americans, and LGBT individuals.  Overall, the number of reported hate crimes increased six percent – a number that does not account for the many hate crimes that may go unreported out of shame or fear. “Beyond these 2015 statistics, I know that many Americans are concerned by a spate of recent news reports about alleged hate crimes and harassment.  Some of these incidents have happened in schools.  Others have targeted houses of worship.  And some have singled out individuals for attacks and intimidation.  The FBI is assessing, in conjunction with federal prosecutors, whether particular incidents constitute violations of federal law.  We need you to continue to report these incidents to local law enforcement, as well as the Justice Department, so that our career investigators and prosecutors can take action to defend your rights.  You can find information about federal hate crimes laws – and other civil rights laws that the department enforces, including protections for students in schools – on our Civil Rights Division’s website.  Our site also contains resources for communities working to prevent and respond to hate crimes, as well. “Last month marked the seventh anniversary of one of those laws: the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  This landmark statute was named for two men who were killed for the most un-American of reasons – because they were different from their attackers – Matthew Shepard in his sexual orientation, and James Byrd Jr. in his race.  The law that bears their names significantly expanded our ability to combat hate crimes by adding new federal protections against crimes based on one’s gender identity, sexual orientation, gender, or disability status – protections that we have worked tirelessly to uphold in the last seven years. “But despite the tremendous progress we have made, we cannot lose sight of how much remains to be done.  Nearly two decades after Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. were brutally murdered simply for being who they were, we still have a long way to go to ensure that every American can live free from the fear of violence or harassment based what they look like, how they worship, or whom they love. “That work is not just about enforcing the law.  It’s about staying true to our highest ideals and most cherished principles.  It’s about making sure that all Americans receive the protection of the law.  And it’s about giving real meaning to our shared belief that all people are created equal. “Put simply, this work is the right – and just – thing to do.  And I want the American people to know that as long as that work is necessary, the Department of Justice will continue to carry it forward.  We will continue to enforce our nation’s hate crimes laws to the fullest extent possible.  We will continue to uphold our conviction that all men and women deserve to lead lives of safety and dignity.  And we will continue to champion the values of diversity and inclusion that have always been the bedrock of our nation’s progress, and that point the way to a brighter future.  Thank you.”   \n",

Lynch released the following statement today after the ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in the North Carolina voting case:  “I am pleased that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has struck down a law that the court described in its ruling as “one of the largest restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history.”  As the court found, this law was passed with discriminatory intent.  It targeted African-Americans “with almost surgical precision” – imposing stringent ID requirements, reducing same-day registration and constraining out-of-precinct voting to place barriers between citizens and the ballot box.  And it sent a message that contradicted some of the most basic principles of our democracy.  The ability of Americans to have a voice in the direction of their country – to have a fair and free opportunity to help write the story of this nation – is fundamental to who we are and who we aspire to be.  Going forward, the Department of Justice will continue our work to protect that sacred right for all.”   \n",

jury returned a four-count indictment today against Justin Whittington, 24, of Bakersfield, California, charging him with interfering with a person’s housing rights because of his race, color or national origin by use of force or threat of force, use of a firearm during a crime of violence, unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm and making a false statement to a special agent of the FBI, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and U. S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner of the Eastern District of California. According to court documents, on Dec. 19, 2012, Whittington shouted racist slurs at a Latino man outside the Latino man’s home in Oildale, California, and fired a sawed off shot gun in an attempt to intimidate and interfere with the victim’s occupancy of his home because of his race, color or national origin. This case is the product of an investigation by the FBI and the Kern County, California, Sheriff’s Office. Trial Attorney Samantha Trepel of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U. S. Attorney Brian K. Delaney of the Eastern District of California are prosecuting the case. If convicted, Whittington faces a maximum statutory penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine.

            Travis Reynolds, 21, of Baltimore, pleaded guilty today to one count of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which makes it a federal crime to damage the property of a reproductive health services facility because of the services offered there. The charge stems from incidents that occurred late in the evening on Feb. 24, 2016, and early in the morning on Feb. 25, 2016, when Reynolds and another man decided to vandalize a Baltimore area women’s health care clinic.  Reynolds spray-painted the words “Baby Killer,” “Kill Baby Here” and other graphic messages across the building where the clinic is located. During his guilty plea before U.S. Magistrate Judge Beth Gesner of the District of Maryland, Reynolds admitted that he vandalized the clinic because it offered abortion services.  At the time of his arrest, Reynolds admitted to police that he defaced the clinic’s doors, walls and windows because he thought that it would deter women from using the clinic. “The Justice Department will continue to aggressively enforce the FACE Act, which makes it a crime to intentionally damage a clinic because it offers reproductive health services,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.  “While people have a First Amendment right to peacefully express their views, they do not have a right to vandalize clinics in the hopes of deterring women from receiving lawful services that those facilities provide.” The case was investigated by the FBI and the Baltimore County Police Department.  The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Sanjay Patel of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, with assistance from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the District of Maryland.

       "851    Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the following proclamation commemorating January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month: “Human trafficking is a nationwide public health and civil rights crisis. Its victims are everywhere: at truck stops, in cities, in rural areas, and in suburbs, and who now total an unconscionable 25 million victims globally according to some estimates. That means 25 million human beings—parents, siblings, and children—have been coerced into a commercial sex act, forced into labor, or exploited because they desperately seek a better life. It is a priority of the Department of Justice to combat this depraved and predatory behavior through swift and aggressive enforcement of our nation’s laws to bring traffickers to justice and restore the lives of victims and survivors. “The Justice Department’s U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), other federal agencies, and our state, local, and tribal partners, are on the front lines, leading our shared fight against human trafficking in all its forms.  These entities are supported by the Department’s Civil Rights Division which is home to a team of dedicated investigators and prosecutors—the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit (the HTPU)—tasked with bringing human traffickers to justice and vindicating the rights of their victims. Additionally, the Department’s Criminal Division includes the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), which is committed to harnessing expertise in attacking the technological and systemic challenges that are involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, as well as other specialized prosecution teams who bring expertise in organized crime and money laundering. “Our efforts have produced high-impact prosecutions to dismantle transnational organized human trafficking enterprises, have launched interagency anti-trafficking initiatives with unprecedented momentum, and have vindicated the rights and freedoms of countless victims and survivors.  “These efforts resulted in the conviction of nearly 500 defendants in trafficking cases in fiscal year 2017, and making $47 million available to help trafficking survivors.  Last fall, the FBI—along with state and local task forces and international law enforcement partners—recovered 84 minors and arrested 120 traffickers, as part a single week-long operation. However, we are keenly aware that many challenges lie ahead and we are committed to taking our efforts to the next level. “In his Presidential Proclamation, President Trump asked us to ‘recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement’ and to ‘pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking.’ In the spirit of the President’s request, the Justice Department is hosting a Human Trafficking Summit in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 2018, two days before Super Bowl LII.  The Super Bowl provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the surge in commercial sex activity around major sporting events, and of our commitment to finding and protecting sex trafficking victims who are at risk of being compelled, coerced, or exploited as minors in that context. “The Human Trafficking Summit will be led by Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand and will convene law enforcement, victim support organizations, and the business community to focus on enhancing the strong partnerships behind all successful anti-trafficking efforts and identifying opportunities to increase collaboration and coordination as we take on new challenges. “There is no room in a civilized society for those who choose to violate an individual’s rights and freedoms by subjecting them to any form of human trafficking. To those that still make that choice: make no mistake, the Justice Department will use every lawful tool to uncover your illegal activity and bring you to justice.”\n",

       "496    WASHINGTON - Gary Dodson, 32, of Waldron, Ark., pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., to one count of civil rights conspiracy, one count of interference with housing rights due to race and one count of possession of an unregistered firearm/destructive device for his involvement in the Jan. 14, 2011, racially motivated firebombing of the home of an interracial couple in Hardy, Ark. Dodson, along with Jason Barnwell, 37, of Evening Shade, Ark.; Jake Murphy, 19, of Waldron; Dustin Hammond, 20, of Hardy, Ark.; and Wendy Treybig, 31, of Evening Shade, were indicted in April by a federal grand jury on civil rights charges and other federal charges stemming from their participation in the racially motivated firebombing and their attempts to obstruct a federal investigation. During the plea proceedings, Dodson admitted that on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, while at a party at Barnwell’s house in Evening Shade, he, Murphy, Hammond and Barnwell devised a plan to firebomb the victims’ house. Dodson then drove all four men from Barnwell’s residence to the victims’ house in Hardy. When they arrived, Barnwell, Murphy and Hammond constructed three Molotov cocktails and threw them at the house. They damaged the victims’ house, however, the victims were not injured. “The victims’ home was attacked and their safety threatened because of their race. Such violence and intimidation has no place in our society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts of hate.” “Today’s plea begins the final chapter in a terrible story begun less than a year ago on the night of Jan. 14, 2011, in a small Northeast Arkansas community,” said Christopher R. Thyer, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  “Racially motivated violence, more than any other type, tears at the very fabric of what makes America and Arkansas great.  We should be celebrating our diversity rather than committing acts of violence because of it.  When it occurs, my office will vigorously prosecute it.” Dodson faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for April 6, 2012. Barnwell, Murphy, Hammond and Treybig have already pleaded guilty for their involvement in this matter. This case was investigated by the Little Rock Office of the FBI and the Little Rock Office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with assistance from the Arkansas State Police, the Hardy and Waldron Police Departments, and the Scott and Sharp County Sheriff’s Offices. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Trial Attorneys Cindy Chung and Henry Leventis of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.\n",

       "157    An Alabama native was indicted today and charged with multiple crimes involving travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors and child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Kenyen R. Brown of the Southern District of Alabama. Clarence Edward Evers Jr., aka Bud, a technology teacher employed by the Conecuh County, Alabama, Board of Education, was arrested on Feb. 11, 2016, and was charged today with five counts of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of attempted travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of production and attempted production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography, one count of receipt of child pornography, one count of access with intent to view child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. According to the indictment, Evers allegedly traveled to Thailand in the summers of 2010 through 2014 for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and allegedly attempted to make a similar trip in the spring of 2015.  During the 2014 trip, Evers also allegedly photographed his victims’ abuse and then transported the images back to the United States.  In addition, Evers allegedly had other images of child sexual exploitation on his computers and other electronic devices. The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  Evers is presumed innocent unless and until he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. ICE-HSI is investigating this case.  Trial Attorney James E. Burke IV of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean P. Costello and Maria E. Murphy of the Southern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.\n",
